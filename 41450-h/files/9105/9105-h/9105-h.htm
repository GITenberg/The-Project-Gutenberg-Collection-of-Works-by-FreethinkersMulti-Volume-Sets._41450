    <h2>
      <a name="linkpreface" id="linkpreface">Translator's Preface.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some apology must be made for an attempt "to translate the
      untranslatable." Notwithstanding there are no less than eight English
      translations of La Rochefoucauld, hardly any are readable, none are free
      from faults, and all fail more or less to convey the author's meaning.
      Though so often translated, there is not a complete English edition of the
      Maxims and Reflections. All the translations are confined exclusively to
      the Maxims, none include the Reflections. This may be accounted for, from
      the fact that most of the translations are taken from the old editions of
      the Maxims, in which the Reflections do not appear. Until M. Suard devoted
      his attention to the text of Rochefoucauld, the various editions were but
      reprints of the preceding ones, without any regard to the alterations made
      by the author in the later editions published during his life-time. So
      much was this the case, that Maxims which had been rejected by
      Rochefoucauld in his last edition, were still retained in the body of the
      work. To give but one example, the celebrated Maxim as to the misfortunes
      of our friends, was omitted in the last edition of the book, published in
      Rochefoucauld's life-time, yet in every English edition this Maxim appears
      in the body of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Aim&eacute; Martin in 1827 published an edition of the Maxims and
      Reflections which has ever since been the standard text of Rochefoucauld
      in France. The Maxims are printed from the edition of 1678, the last
      published during the author's life, and the last which received his
      corrections. To this edition were added two Supplements; the first
      containing the Maxims which had appeared in the editions of 1665, 1666,
      and 1675, and which were afterwards omitted; the second, some additional
      Maxims found among various of the author's manuscripts in the Royal
      Library at Paris. And a Series of Reflections which had been previously
      published in a work called "Receuil de pi&egrave;ces d'histoire et de litt&eacute;rature."
      Paris, 1731. They were first published with the Maxims in an edition by
      Gabriel Brotier.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an edition of Rochefoucauld entitled "Reflexions, ou Sentences et
      Maximes Morales, augment&eacute;es de plus deux cent nouvelles Maximes et
      Maximes et Pens&eacute;es diverses suivant les copies Imprim&eacute;es
      &agrave; Paris, chez Claude Barbin, et Matre Cramoisy 1692,"* some fifty
      Maxims were added, ascribed by the editor to Rochefoucauld, and as his
      family allowed them to be published under his name, it seems probable they
      were genuine. These fifty form the third supplement to this book.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          *In all the French editions this book is spoken of as published in
          1693. The only copy I have seen is in the Cambridge University
          Library, 47, 16, 81, and is called "Reflexions Morales."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The apology for the present edition of Rochefoucauld must therefore be
      twofold: firstly, that it is an attempt to give the public a complete
      English edition of Rochefoucauld's works as a moralist. The body of the
      work comprises the Maxims as the author finally left them, the first
      supplement, those published in former editions, and rejected by the author
      in the later; the second, the unpublished Maxims taken from the author's
      correspondence and manuscripts, and the third, the Maxims first published
      in 1692. While the Reflections, in which the thoughts in the Maxims are
      extended and elaborated, now appear in English for the first time. And
      secondly, that it is an attempt (to quote the preface of the edition of
      1749) "to do the Duc de la Rochefoucauld the justice to make him speak
      English."

    <h2>
      <a name="linkintroduction" id="linkintroduction">Translator's Introduction</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The description of the "ancien regime" in France, "a despotism tempered by
      epigrams," like most epigrammatic sentences, contains some truth, with
      much fiction. The society of the last half of the seventeenth, and the
      whole of the eighteenth centuries, was doubtless greatly influenced by the
      precise and terse mode in which the popular writers of that date expressed
      their thoughts. To a people naturally inclined to think that every
      possible view, every conceivable argument, upon a question is included in
      a short aphorism, a shrug, and the word "voil&agrave;," truths expressed
      in condensed sentences must always have a peculiar charm. It is, perhaps,
      from this love of epigram, that we find so many eminent French writers of
      maxims. Pascal, De Retz, La Rochefoucauld, La Bruy&egrave;re, Montesquieu,
      and Vauvenargues, each contributed to the rich stock of French epigrams.
      No other country can show such a list of brilliant writers&mdash;in
      England certainly we cannot. Our most celebrated, Lord Bacon, has, by his
      other works, so surpassed his maxims, that their fame is, to a great
      measure, obscured. The only Englishman who could have rivalled La
      Rochefoucauld or La Bruy&egrave;re was the Earl of Chesterfield, and he
      only could have done so from his very intimate connexion with France; but
      unfortunately his brilliant genius was spent in the impossible task of
      trying to refine a boorish young Briton, in "cutting blocks with a razor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the French epigrammatic writers La Rochefoucauld is at once the
      most widely known, and the most distinguished. Voltaire, whose opinion on
      the century of Louis XIV. is entitled to the greatest weight, says, "One
      of the works that most largely contributed to form the taste of the
      nation, and to diffuse a spirit of justice and precision, is the
      collection of maxims, by Francois Duc de la Rochefoucauld."
    </p>
    <p>
      This Francois, the second Duc de la Rochefoucauld, Prince de Marsillac,
      the author of the maxims, was one of the most illustrious members of the
      most illustrious families among the French noblesse. Descended from the
      ancient Dukes of Guienne, the founder of the Family Fulk or Foucauld, a
      younger branch of the House of Lusignan, was at the commencement of the
      eleventh century the Seigneur of a small town, La Roche, in the Angounois.
      Our chief knowledge of this feudal lord is drawn from the monkish
      chronicles. As the benefactor of the various abbeys and monasteries in his
      province, he is naturally spoken of by them in terms of eulogy, and in the
      charter of one of the abbeys of Angouleme he is called, "vir nobilissimus
      Fulcaldus." His territorial power enabled him to adopt what was then, as
      is still in Scotland, a common custom, to prefix the name of his estate to
      his surname, and thus to create and transmit to his descendants the
      illustrious surname of La Rochefoucauld.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time until that great crisis in the history of the French
      aristocracy, the Revolution of 1789, the family of La Rochefoucauld have
      been, "if not first, in the very first line" of that most illustrious
      body. One Seigneur served under Philip Augustus against Richard Coeur de
      Lion, and was made prisoner at the battle of Gisors. The eighth Seigneur
      Guy performed a great tilt at Bordeaux, attended (according to Froissart)
      to the Lists by some two hundred of his kindred and relations. The
      sixteenth Seigneur Francais was chamberlain to Charles VIII. and Louis
      XII., and stood at the font as sponsor, giving his name to that last light
      of French chivalry, Francis I. In 1515 he was created a baron, and was
      afterwards advanced to a count, on account of his great service to Francis
      and his predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second count pushed the family fortune still further by obtaining a
      patent as the Prince de Marsillac. His widow, Anne de Polignac,
      entertained Charles V. at the family chateau at Verteuil, in so princely a
      manner that on leaving Charles observed, "He had never entered a house so
      redolent of high virtue, uprightness, and lordliness as that mansion."
    </p>
    <p>
      The third count, after serving with distinction under the Duke of Guise
      against the Spaniards, was made prisoner at St. Quintin, and only regained
      his liberty to fall a victim to the "bloody infamy" of St. Bartholomew.
      His son, the fourth count, saved with difficulty from that massacre, after
      serving with distinction in the religious wars, was taken prisoner in a
      skirmish at St. Yriex la Perche, and murdered by the Leaguers in cold
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifth count, one of the ministers of Louis XIII., after fighting
      against the English and Buckingham at the Ile de R&eacute;, was created a
      duke. His son Francis, the second duke, by his writings has made the
      family name a household word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third duke fought in many of the earlier campaigns of Louis XIV. at
      Torcy, Lille, Cambray, and was dangerously wounded at the passage of the
      Rhine. From his bravery he rose to high favour at Court, and was appointed
      Master of the Horse (Grand Veneur) and Lord Chamberlain. His son, the
      fourth duke, commanded the regiment of Navarre, and took part in storming
      the village of Neerwinden on the day when William III. was defeated at
      Landen. He was afterwards created Duc de la Rochequyon and Marquis de
      Liancourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifth duke, banished from Court by Louis XV., became the friend of the
      philosopher Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sixth duke, the friend of Condorcet, was the last of the long line of
      noble lords who bore that distinguished name. In those terrible days of
      September, 1792, when the French people were proclaiming universal
      humanity, the duke was seized as an aristocrat by the mob at Gisors and
      put to death behind his own carriage, in which sat his mother and his
      wife, at the very place where, some six centuries previously, his ancestor
      had been taken prisoner in a fair fight. A modern writer has spoken of
      this murder "as an admirable reprisal upon the grandson for the writings
      and conduct of the grandfather." But M. Sainte Beuve observes as to this,
      he can see nothing admirable in the death of the duke, and if it proves
      anything, it is only that the grandfather was not so wrong in his judgment
      of men as is usually supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francis, the author, was born on the 15th December 1615. M. Sainte Beuve
      divides his life into four periods, first, from his birth till he was
      thirty-five, when he became mixed up in the war of the Fronde; the second
      period, during the progress of that war; the third, the twelve years that
      followed, while he recovered from his wounds, and wrote his maxims during
      his retirement from society; and the last from that time till his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same way that Herodotus calls each book of his history by the name
      of one of the muses, so each of these four periods of La Rochefoucauld's
      life may be associated with the name of a woman who was for the time his
      ruling passion. These four ladies are the Duchesse de Chevreuse, the
      Duchesse de Longueville, Madame de Sabl&eacute;, and Madame de La Fayette.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Rochefoucauld's early education was neglected; his father, occupied in
      the affairs of state, either had not, or did not devote any time to his
      education. His natural talents and his habits of observation soon,
      however, supplied all deficiencies. By birth and station placed in the
      best society of the French Court, he soon became a most finished courtier.
      Knowing how precarious Court favour then was, his father, when young
      Rochefoucauld was only nine years old, sent him into the army. He was
      subsequently attached to the regiment of Auvergne. Though but sixteen he
      was present, and took part in the military operations at the siege of
      Cassel. The Court of Louis XIII. was then ruled imperiously by Richelieu.
      The Duke de la Rochefoucauld was strongly opposed to the Cardinal's party.
      By joining in the plots of Gaston of Orleans, he gave Richelieu an
      opportunity of ridding Paris of his opposition. When those plots were
      discovered, the Duke was sent into a sort of banishment to Blois. His son,
      who was then at Court with him, was, upon the pretext of a liaison with
      Mdlle. d'Hautefort, one of the ladies in waiting on the Queen (Anne of
      Austria), but in reality to prevent the Duke learning what was passing at
      Paris, sent with his father. The result of the exile was Rochefoucauld's
      marriage. With the exception that his wife's name was Mdlle. Vivonne, and
      that she was the mother of five sons and three daughters, nothing is known
      of her. While Rochefoucauld and his father were at Blois, the Duchesse de
      Chevreuse, one of the beauties of the Court, and the mistress of Louis,
      was banished to Tours. She and Rochefoucauld met, and soon became
      intimate, and for a time she was destined to be the one motive of his
      actions. The Duchesse was engaged in a correspondence with the Court of
      Spain and the Queen. Into this plot Rochefoucauld threw himself with all
      his energy; his connexion with the Queen brought him back to his old love
      Mdlle. d'Hautefort, and led him to her party, which he afterwards
      followed. The course he took shut him off from all chance of Court favour.
      The King regarded him with coldness, the Cardinal with irritation.
      Although the Bastile and the scaffold, the fate of Chalais and
      Montmorency, were before his eyes, they failed to deter him from plotting.
      He was about twenty-three; returning to Paris, he warmly sided with the
      Queen. He says in his Memoirs that the only persons she could then trust
      were himself and Mdlle. d'Hautefort, and it was proposed he should take
      both of them from Paris to Brussels. Into this plan he entered with all
      his youthful indiscretion, it being for several reasons the very one he
      would wish to adopt, as it would strengthen his influence with Anne of
      Austria, place Richelieu and his master in an uncomfortable position, and
      save Mdlle. d'Hautefort from the attentions the King was showing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Richelieu of course discovered this plot, and Rochefoucauld was, of
      course, sent to the Bastile. He was liberated after a week's imprisonment,
      but banished to his chateau at Verteuil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for this clemency was that the Cardinal desired to win
      Rochefoucauld from the Queen's party. A command in the army was offered to
      him, but by the Queen's orders refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some three years Rochefoucauld remained at Verteuil, waiting the time
      for his reckoning with Richelieu; speculating on the King's death, and the
      favours he would then receive from the Queen. During this period he was
      more or less engaged in plotting against his enemy the Cardinal, and
      hatching treason with Cinq Mars and De Thou.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Sainte Beuve says, that unless we study this first part of
      Rochefoucauld's life, we shall never understand his maxims. The bitter
      disappointment of the passionate love, the high hopes then formed, the
      deceit and treachery then witnessed, furnished the real key to their
      meaning. The cutting cynicism of the morality was built on the ruins of
      that chivalrous ambition and romantic affection. He saw his friend Cinq
      Mars sent to the scaffold, himself betrayed by men whom he had trusted,
      and the only reason he could assign for these actions was intense
      selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Richelieu died. Rochefoucauld returned to Court, and found Anne
      of Austria regent, and Mazarin minister. The Queen's former friends
      flocked there in numbers, expecting that now their time of prosperity had
      come. They were bitterly disappointed. Mazarin relied on hope instead of
      gratitude, to keep the Queen's adherents on his side. The most that any
      received were promises that were never performed. In after years,
      doubtless, Rochefoucauld's recollection of his disappointment led him to
      write the maxim: "We promise according to our hopes, we perform according
      to our fears." But he was not even to receive promises; he asked for the
      Governorship of Havre, which was then vacant. He was flatly refused.
      Disappointment gave rise to anger, and uniting with his old flame, the
      Duchesse de Chevreuse, who had received the same treatment, and with the
      Duke of Beaufort, they formed a conspiracy against the government. The
      plot was, of course, discovered and crushed. Beaufort was arrested, the
      Duchesse banished. Irritated and disgusted, Rochefoucauld went with the
      Duc d'Enghein, who was then joining the army, on a campaign, and here he
      found the one love of his life, the Duke's sister, Mdme. de Longueville.
      This lady, young, beautiful, and accomplished, obtained a great ascendancy
      over Rochefoucauld, and was the cause of his taking the side of Cond&eacute;
      in the subsequent civil war. Rochefoucauld did not stay long with the
      army. He was badly wounded at the siege of Mardik, and returned from
      thence to Paris. On recovering from his wounds, the war of the Fronde
      broke out. This war is said to have been most ridiculous, as being carried
      on without a definite object, a plan, or a leader. But this description is
      hardly correct; it was the struggle of the French nobility against the
      rule of the Court; an attempt, the final attempt, to recover their lost
      influence over the state, and to save themselves from sinking under the
      rule of cardinals and priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the general history of that war we have nothing to do; it is far too
      complicated and too confused to be stated here. The memoirs of
      Rochefoucauld and De Retz will give the details to those who desire to
      trace the contests of the factions&mdash;the course of the intrigues. We
      may confine ourselves to its progress so far as it relates to the Duc de
      la Rochefoucauld.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Cardinal causing the Princes de Cond&eacute; and Conti, and the Duc
      de Longueville, to be arrested, Rochefoucauld and the Duchess fled into
      Normandy. Leaving her at Dieppe, he went into Poitou, of which province he
      had some years previously bought the post of governor. He was there joined
      by the Duc de Bouillon, and he and the Duke marched to, and occupied
      Bordeaux. Cardinal Mazarin and Marechal de la Meilleraie advanced in force
      on Bordeaux, and attacked the town. A bloody battle followed.
      Rochefoucauld defended the town with the greatest bravery, and repulsed
      the Cardinal. Notwithstanding the repulse, the burghers of Bordeaux were
      anxious to make peace, and save the city from destruction. The Parliament
      of Bordeaux compelled Rochefoucauld to surrender. He did so, and returned
      nominally to Poitou, but in reality in secret to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he found the Queen engaged in trying to maintain her position by
      playing off the rival parties of the Prince Cond&eacute; and the Cardinal
      De Retz against each other. Rochefoucauld eagerly espoused his old party&mdash;that
      of Cond&eacute;. In August, 1651, the contending parties met in the Hall
      of the Parliament of Paris, and it was with great difficulty they were
      prevented from coming to blows even there. It is even said that
      Rochefoucauld had ordered his followers to murder De Retz.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rochefoucauld was soon to undergo a bitter disappointment. While occupied
      with party strife and faction in Paris, Madame de Chevreuse left him, and
      formed an alliance with the Duc de Nemours. Rochefoucauld still loved her.
      It was, probably, thinking of this that he afterwards wrote, "Jealousy is
      born with love, but does not die with it." He endeavoured to get Madame de
      Chatillon, the old mistress of the Duc de Nemours, reinstated in favour,
      but in this he did not succeed. The Duc de Nemours was soon after killed
      in a duel. The war went on, and after several indecisive skirmishes, the
      decisive battle was fought at Paris, in the Faubourg St. Antoine, where
      the Parisians first learnt the use or the abuse of their favourite
      defence, the barricade. In this battle, Rochefoucauld behaved with great
      bravery. He was wounded in the head, a wound which for a time deprived him
      of his sight. Before he recovered, the war was over, Louis XIV. had
      attained his majority, the gold of Mazarin, the arms of Turenne, had been
      successful, the French nobility were vanquished, the court supremacy
      established.
    </p>
    <p>
      This completed Rochefoucauld's active life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he recovered his health, he devoted himself to society. Madame de
      Sabl&eacute; assumed a hold over him. He lived a quiet life, and occupied
      himself in composing an account of his early life, called his "Memoirs,"
      and his immortal "Maxims."
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time he ceased to take part in public life, Rochefoucauld's real
      glory began. Having acted the various parts of soldier, politician, and
      lover with but small success, he now commenced the part of moralist, by
      which he is known to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living in the most brilliant society that France possessed, famous from
      his writings, distinguished from the part he had taken in public affairs,
      he formed the centre of one of those remarkable French literary societies,
      a society which numbered among its members La Fontaine, Racine, Boileau.
      Among his most attached friends was Madame de La Fayette (the authoress of
      the "Princess of Cleeves"), and this friendship continued until his death.
      He was not, however, destined to pass away in that gay society without
      some troubles. At the passage of the Rhine in 1672 two of his sons were
      engaged; the one was killed, the other severely wounded. Rochefoucauld was
      much affected by this, but perhaps still more by the death of the young
      Duc de Longueville, who perished on the same occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sainte Beuve says that the cynical book and that young life were the only
      fruits of the war of the Fronde. Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;, who was
      with him when he heard the news of the death of so much that was dear to
      him, says, "I saw his heart laid bare on that cruel occasion, and his
      courage, his merit, his tenderness, and good sense surpassed all I ever
      met with. I hold his wit and accomplishments as nothing in comparison."
      The combined effect of his wounds and the gout caused the last years of
      Rochefoucauld's life to be spent in great pain. Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;,
      who was {with} him continually during his last illness, speaks of the
      fortitude with which he bore his sufferings as something to be admired.
      Writing to her daughter, she says, "Believe me, it is not for nothing he
      has moralised all his life; he has thought so often on his last moments
      that they are nothing new or unfamiliar to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      In his last illness, the great moralist was attended by the great divine,
      Bossuet. Whether that matchless eloquence or his own philosophic calm had,
      in spite of his writings, brought him into the state Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;
      describes, we know not; but one, or both, contributed to his passing away
      in a manner that did not disgrace a French noble or a French philosopher.
      On the 11th March, 1680, he ended his stormy life in peace after so much
      strife, a loyal subject after so much treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his friends, Madame Deshouli&egrave;res, shortly before he died
      sent him an ode on death, which aptly describes his state&mdash; "Oui,
      soyez alors plus ferme, Que ces vulgaires humains Qui, pr&egrave;s de leur
      dernier terme, De vaines terreurs sont pleins. En sage que rien n'offense,
      Livrez-vous sans resistance A d'in&eacute;vitables traits; Et, d'une
      demarche &eacute;gale, Passez cette onde fatal Qu'on ne repasse jamais."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rochefoucauld left behind him only two works, the one, Memoirs of his own
      time, the other the Maxims. The first described the scenes in which his
      youth had been spent, and though written in a lively style, and giving
      faithful pictures of the intrigues and the scandals of the court during
      Louis XIV.'s minority, yet, except to the historian, has ceased at the
      present day to be of much interest. It forms, perhaps, the true key to
      understand the special as opposed to general application of the maxims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the assertion of Bayle, that "there are few people so
      bigoted to antiquity as not to prefer the Memoirs of La Rochefoucauld to
      the Commentaries of Caesar," or the statement of Voltaire, "that the
      Memoirs are universally read and the Maxims are learnt by heart," few
      persons at the present day ever heard of the Memoirs, and the knowledge of
      most as to the Maxims is confined to that most celebrated of all, though
      omitted from his last edition, "There is something in the misfortunes of
      our best friends which does not wholly displease us." Yet it is difficult
      to assign a cause for this; no book is perhaps oftener unwittingly quoted,
      none certainly oftener unblushingly pillaged; upon none have so many
      contradictory opinions been given.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Few books," says Mr. Hallam, "have been more highly extolled, or more
      severely blamed, than the maxims of the Duke of Rochefoucauld, and that
      not only here, but also in France." Rousseau speaks of it as, "a sad and
      melancholy book," though he goes on to say "it is usually so in youth when
      we do not like seeing man as he is." Voltaire says of it, in the words
      above quoted, "One of the works which most contributed to form the taste
      of the (French) nation, and to give it a spirit of justness and precision,
      was the collection of the maxims of Francois Duc de la Rochefoucauld,
      though there is scarcely more than one truth running through the book&mdash;that
      &lsquo;self-love is the motive of everything'&mdash;yet this thought is
      presented under so many varied aspects that it is nearly always striking.
      It is not so much a book as it is materials for ornamenting a book. This
      little collection was read with avidity, it taught people to think, and to
      comprise their thoughts in a lively, precise, and delicate turn of
      expression. This was a merit which, before him, no one in Europe had
      attained since the revival of letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson speaks of it as "the only book written by a man of fashion, of
      which professed authors need be jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Chesterfield, in his letters to his son, says, "Till you come to know
      mankind by your experience, I know no thing nor no man that can in the
      meantime bring you so well acquainted with them as Le Duc de la
      Rochefoucauld. His little book of maxims, which I would advise you to look
      into for some moments at least every day of your life, is, I fear, too
      like and too exact a picture of human nature. I own it seems to degrade
      it, but yet my experience does not convince me that it degrades it
      unjustly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop Butler, on the other hand, blames the book in no measured terms.
      "There is a strange affectation," says the bishop, "in some people of
      explaining away all particular affection, and representing the whole life
      as nothing but one continued exercise of self-love. Hence arise that
      surprising confusion and perplexity in the Epicureans of old, Hobbes, the
      author of 'Reflexions Morales,' and the whole set of writers, of calling
      actions interested which are done of the most manifest known interest,
      merely for the gratification of a present passion."
    </p>
    <p>
      The judgment the reader will be most inclined to adopt will perhaps be
      either that of Mr. Hallam, "Concise and energetic in expression, reduced
      to those short aphorisms which leave much to the reader's acuteness and
      yet save his labour, not often obscure, and never wearisome, an evident
      generalisation of long experience, without pedantry, without method,
      without deductive reasonings, yet wearing an appearance at least of
      profundity; they delight the intelligent though indolent man of the world,
      and must be read with some admiration by the philosopher . . . . yet they
      bear witness to the contracted observation and the precipitate inferences
      which an intercourse with a single class of society scarcely fails to
      generate." Or that of Addison, who speaks of Rochefoucauld "as the great
      philosopher for administering consolation to the idle, the curious, and
      the worthless part of mankind."
    </p>
    <p>
      We are fortunately in possession of materials such as rarely exist to
      enable us to form a judgment of Rochefoucauld's character. We have, with a
      vanity that could only exist in a Frenchman, a description or portrait of
      himself, of his own painting, and one of those inimitable living sketches
      in which his great enemy, Cardinal De Retz, makes all the chief actors in
      the court of the regency of Anne of Austria pass across the stage before
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will first look on the portrait Rochefoucauld has left us of himself:
      "I am," says he, "of a medium height, active, and well-proportioned. My
      complexion dark, but uniform, a high forehead; and of moderate height,
      black eyes, small, deep set, eyebrows black and thick but well placed. I
      am rather embarrassed in talking of my nose, for it is neither flat nor
      aquiline, nor large; nor pointed: but I believe, as far as I can say, it
      is too large than too small, and comes down just a trifle too low. I have
      a large mouth, lips generally red enough, neither shaped well nor badly. I
      have white teeth, and fairly even. I have been told I have a little too
      much chin. I have just looked at myself in the glass to ascertain the
      fact, and I do not know how to decide. As to the shape of my face, it is
      either square or oval, but which I should find it very difficult to say. I
      have black hair, which curls by nature, and thick and long enough to
      entitle me to lay claim to a fine head. I have in my countenance somewhat
      of grief and pride, which gives many people an idea I despise them,
      although I am not at all given to do so. My gestures are very free, rather
      inclined to be too much so, for in speaking they make me use too much
      action. Such, candidly, I believe I am in outward appearance, and I
      believe it will be found that what I have said above of myself is not far
      from the real case. I shall use the same truthfulness in the remainder of
      my picture, for I have studied myself sufficiently to know myself well;
      and I will lack neither boldness to speak as freely as I can of my good
      qualities, nor sincerity to freely avow that I have faults.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, to speak of my temper. I am melancholy, and I have
      hardly been seen for the last three or four years to laugh above three or
      four times. It seems to me that my melancholy would be even endurable and
      pleasant if I had none but what belonged to me constitutionally; but it
      arises from so many other causes, fills my imagination in such a way, and
      possesses my mind so strongly that for the greater part of my time I
      remain without speaking a word, or give no meaning to what I say. I am
      extremely reserved to those I do not know, and I am not very open with the
      greater part of those I do. It is a fault I know well, and I should
      neglect no means to correct myself of it; but as a certain gloomy air I
      have tends to make me seem more reserved than I am in fact, and as it is
      not in our power to rid ourselves of a bad expression that arises from a
      natural conformation of features, I think that even when I have cured
      myself internally, externally some bad expression will always remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have ability. I have no hesitation in saying it, as for what purpose
      should I pretend otherwise. So great circumvention, and so great
      depreciation, in speaking of the gifts one has, seems to me to hide a
      little vanity under an apparent modesty, and craftily to try to make
      others believe in greater virtues than are imputed to us. On my part I am
      content not to be considered better-looking than I am, nor of a better
      temper than I describe, nor more witty and clever than I am. Once more, I
      have ability, but a mind spoilt by melancholy, for though I know my own
      language tolerably well, and have a good memory, a mode of thought not
      particularly confused, I yet have so great a mixture of discontent that I
      often say what I have to say very badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The conversation of gentlemen is one of the pleasures that most amuses
      me. I like it to be serious and morality to form the substance of it. Yet
      I also know how to enjoy it when trifling; and if I do not make many witty
      speeches, it is not because I do not appreciate the value of trifles well
      said, and that I do not find great amusement in that manner of raillery in
      which certain prompt and ready-witted persons excel so well. I write well
      in prose; I do well in verse; and if I was envious of the glory that
      springs from that quarter, I think with a little labour I could acquire
      some reputation. I like reading, in general; but that in which one finds
      something to polish the wit and strengthen the soul is what I like best.
      But, above all, I have the greatest pleasure in reading with an
      intelligent person, for then we reflect constantly upon what we read, and
      the observations we make form the most pleasant and useful form of
      conversation there is.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a fair critic of the works in verse and prose that are shown me; but
      perhaps I speak my opinion with almost too great freedom. Another fault in
      me is that I have sometimes a spirit of delicacy far too scrupulous, and a
      spirit of criticism far too severe. I do not dislike an argument, and I
      often of my own free will engage in one; but I generally back my opinion
      with too much warmth, and sometimes, when the wrong side is advocated
      against me, from the strength of my zeal for reason, I become a little
      unreasonable myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have virtuous sentiments, good inclinations, and so strong a desire to
      be a wholly good man that my friend cannot afford me a greater pleasure
      than candidly to show me my faults. Those who know me most intimately, and
      those who have the goodness sometimes to give me the above advice, know
      that I always receive it with all the joy that could be expected, and with
      all reverence of mind that could be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have all the passions pretty mildly, and pretty well under control. I
      am hardly ever seen in a rage, and I never hated any one. I am not,
      however, incapable of avenging myself if I have been offended, or if my
      honour demanded I should resent an insult put upon me; on the contrary, I
      feel clear that duty would so well discharge the office of hatred in me
      that I should follow my revenge with even greater keenness than other
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ambition does not weary me. I fear but few things, and I do not fear
      death in the least. I am but little given to pity, and I could wish I was
      not so at all. Though there is nothing I would not do to comfort an
      afflicted person, and I really believe that one should do all one can to
      show great sympathy to him for his misfortune, for miserable people are so
      foolish that this does them the greatest good in the world; yet I also
      hold that we should be content with expressing sympathy, and carefully
      avoid having any. It is a passion that is wholly worthless in a
      well-regulated mind, which only serves to weaken the heart, and which
      should be left to ordinary persons, who, as they never do anything from
      reason, have need of passions to stimulate their actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love my friends; and I love them to such an extent that I would not for
      a moment weigh my interest against theirs. I condescend to them, I
      patiently endure their bad temper. But, also, I do not make much of their
      caresses, and I do not feel great uneasiness in their absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally, I have but little curiosity about the majority of things that
      stir up curiosity in other men. I am very secret, and I have less
      difficulty than most men in holding my tongue as to what is told me in
      confidence. I am most particular as to my word, and I would never fail,
      whatever might be the consequence, to do what I had promised; and I have
      made this an inflexible law during the whole of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I keep the most punctilious civility to women. I do not believe I have
      ever said anything before them which could cause them annoyance. When
      their intellect is cultivated, I prefer their society to that of men: one
      there finds a mildness one does not meet with among ourselves, and it
      seems to me beyond this that they express themselves with more neatness,
      and give a more agreeable turn to the things they talk about. As for
      flirtation, I formerly indulged in a little, now I shall do so no more,
      though I am still young. I have renounced all flirtation, and I am simply
      astonished that there are still so many sensible people who can occupy
      their time with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wholly approve of real loves; they indicate greatness of soul, and
      although, in the uneasiness they give rise to, there is a something
      contrary to strict wisdom, they fit in so well with the most severe
      virtue, that I believe they cannot be censured with justice. To me who
      have known all that is fine and grand in the lofty aspirations of love, if
      I ever fall in love, it will assuredly be in love of that nature. But in
      accordance with the present turn of my mind, I do not believe that the
      knowledge I have of it will ever change from my mind to my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is his own description of himself. Let us now turn to the other
      picture, delineated by the man who was his bitterest enemy, and whom (we
      say it with regret) Rochefoucauld tried to murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardinal De Retz thus paints him:&mdash; "In M. de la Rochefoucauld there
      was ever an indescribable something. From his infancy he always wanted to
      be mixed up with plots, at a time when he could not understand even the
      smallest interests (which has indeed never been his weak point,) or
      comprehend greater ones, which in another sense has never been his strong
      point. He was never fitted for any matter, and I really cannot tell the
      reason. His glance was not sufficiently wide, and he could not take in at
      once all that lay in his sight, but his good sense, perfect in theories,
      combined with his gentleness, his winning ways, his pleasing manners,
      which are perfect, should more than compensate for his lack of
      penetration. He always had a natural irresoluteness, but I cannot say to
      what this irresolution is to be attributed. It could not arise in him from
      the wealth of his imagination, for that was anything but lively. I cannot
      put it down to the barrenness of his judgment, for, although he was not
      prompt in action, he had a good store of reason. We see the effects of
      this irresolution, although we cannot assign a cause for it. He was never
      a general, though a great soldier; never, naturally, a good courtier,
      although he had always a good idea of being so. He was never a good
      partizan, although all his life engaged in intrigues. That air of pride
      and timidity which your see in his private life, is turned in business
      into an apologetic manner. He always believed he had need of it; and this,
      combined with his &lsquo;Maxims,' which show little faith in virtue, and
      his habitual custom, to give up matters with the same haste he undertook
      them, leads me to the conclusion that he would have done far better to
      have known his own mind, and have passed himself off, as he could have
      done, for the most polished courtier, the most agreeable man in private
      life that had appeared in his century."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is but justice to the Cardinal to say, that the Duc is not painted in
      such dark colours as we should have expected, judging from what we know of
      the character of De Retz. With his marvellous power of depicting
      character, a power unrivalled, except by St. Simon and perhaps by Lord
      Clarendon, we should have expected the malignity of the priest would have
      stamped the features of his great enemy with the impress of infamy, and
      not have simply made him appear a courtier, weak, insincere, and nothing
      more. Though rather beyond our subject, the character of Cardinal de Retz,
      as delineated by Mdme. S&eacute;vign&eacute;, in one of her letters, will
      help us to form a true conclusion on the different characters of the Duc
      and the Cardinal. She says:&mdash; "Paul de Gondi Cardinal de Retz
      possesses great elevation of character, a certain extent of intellect, and
      more of the ostentation than of the true greatness of courage. He has an
      extraordinary memory, more energy than polish in his words, an easy
      humour, docility of character, and weakness in submitting to the
      complaints and reproaches of his friends, a little piety, some appearances
      of religion. He appears ambitious without being really so. Vanity and
      those who have guided him, have made him undertake great things, almost
      all opposed to his profession. He excited the greatest troubles in the
      State without any design of turning them to account, and far from
      declaring himself the enemy of Cardinal Mazarin with any view of occupying
      his place, he thought of nothing but making himself an object of dread to
      him, and flattering himself with the false vanity of being his rival. He
      was clever enough, however, to take advantage of the public calamities to
      get himself made Cardinal. He endured his imprisonment with firmness, and
      owed his liberty solely to his own daring. In the obscurity of a life of
      wandering and concealment, his indolence for many years supported him with
      reputation. He preserved the Archbishopric of Paris against the power of
      Cardinal Mazarin, but after the death of that minister, he resigned it
      without knowing what he was doing, and without making use of the
      opportunity to promote the interests of himself and his friends. He has
      taken part in several conclaves, and his conduct has always increased his
      reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His natural bent is to indolence, nevertheless he labours with activity
      in pressing business, and reposes with indifference when it is concluded.
      He has great presence of mind, and knows so well how to turn it to his own
      advantage on all occasions presented him by fortune, that it would seem as
      if he had foreseen and desired them. He loves to narrate, and seeks to
      dazzle all his listeners indifferently by his extraordinary adventures,
      and his imagination often supplies him with more than his memory. The
      generality of his qualities are false, and what has most contributed to
      his reputation is his power of throwing a good light on his faults. He is
      insensible alike to hatred and to friendship, whatever pains he may be at
      to appear taken up with the one or the other. He is incapable of envy or
      avarice, whether from virtue or from carelessness. He has borrowed more
      from his friends than a private person could ever hope to be able to
      repay; he has felt the vanity of acquiring so much on credit, and of
      undertaking to discharge it. He has neither taste nor refinement; he is
      amused by everything and pleased by nothing. He avoids difficult matters
      with considerable address, not allowing people to penetrate the slight
      acquaintance he has with everything. The retreat he has just made from the
      world is the most brilliant and the most unreal action of his life; it is
      a sacrifice he has made to his pride under the pretence of devotion; he
      quits the court to which he cannot attach himself, and retires from a
      world which is retiring from him."

      The Maxims were first published in 1665, with a preface by Segrais. This
      preface was omitted in the subsequent editions. The first edition
      contained 316 maxims, counting the last upon death, which was not
      numbered. The second in 1666 contained only 102; the third in 1671, and
      the fourth in 1675, 413. In this last edition we first meet with the
      introductory maxim, "Our virtues are generally but disguised vices." The
      edition of 1678, the fifth, increased the number to 504. This was the last
      edition revised by the author, and published in his lifetime. The text of
      that edition has been used for the present translation. The next edition,
      the sixth, was published in 1693, about thirteen years after the author's
      death. This edition included fifty new maxims, attributed by the editor to
      Rochefoucauld. Most likely they were his writing, as the fact was never
      denied by his family, through whose permission they were published. They
      form the third supplement to the translation. This sixth edition was
      published by Claude Barbin, and the French editions since that time have
      been too numerous to be enumerated. The great popularity of the Maxims is
      perhaps best shown from the numerous translations that have been made of
      them. No less than eight English translations, or so-called translations,
      have appeared; one American, a Swedish, and a Spanish translation, an
      Italian imitation, with parallel passages, and an English imitation by
      Hazlitt. The titles of the English editions are as follows:&mdash; i.
      Seneca Unmasked. By Mrs. Aphara Behn. London, 1689. She calls the author
      the Duke of Rushfucave. ii. Moral Maxims and Reflections, in four parts.
      By the Duke de la Rochefoucauld. Now made English. London, 1694. 12 mo.
      iii. Moral Maxims and Reflections of the Duke de la Rochefoucauld. Newly
      made English. London, 1706. 12 mo. iv. Moral Maxims of the Duke de la
      Rochefoucauld. Translated from the French. With notes. London, 1749. 12
      mo. v. Maxims and Moral Reflections of the Duke de la Rochefoucauld.
      Revised and improved. London, 1775. 8 vo. vi. Maxims and Moral Reflections

      Maxims and Moral Reflections. London, 1813. 12 mo. viii. Moral
      Reflections, Sentences, and Maxims of the Duke de la Rochefoucauld, newly
      translated from the French; with an introduction and notes. London, 1850.
      16 mo. ix. Maxims and Moral Reflections of the Duke de la Rochefoucauld:
      with a Memoir by the Chevalier de Chatelain. London, 1868. 12 mo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perusal of the Maxims will suggest to every reader to a greater or
      less degree, in accordance with the extent of his reading, parallel
      passages, and similar ideas. Of ancient writers Rochefoucauld most
      strongly reminds us of Tacitus; of modern writers, Junius most strongly
      reminds us of Rochefoucauld. Some examples from both are given in the
      notes to this translation. It is curious to see how the expressions of the
      bitterest writer of English political satire to a great extent express the
      same ideas as the great French satirist of private life. Had space
      permitted the parallel could have been drawn very closely, and much of the
      invective of Junius traced to its source in Rochefoucauld.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the persons whom Rochefoucauld patronised and protected, was the
      great French fabulist, La Fontaine. This patronage was repaid by La
      Fontaine giving, in one of his fables, "L'Homme et son Image," an
      elaborate defence of his patron. After there depicting a man who fancied
      himself one of the most lovely in the world, and who complained he always
      found all mirrors untrustworthy, at last discovered his real image
      reflected in the water. He thus applies his fable:&mdash; "Je parle
      &agrave; tous: et cette erreur extr&ecirc;me, Est un mal que chacun se
      plait d'entretenir, Notre &acirc;me, c'est cet homme amoureux de lui m&ecirc;me,
      Tant de miroirs, ce sont les sottises d'autrui. Miroirs, de nos d&eacute;fauts
      les peintres l&eacute;gitimes, Et quant au canal, c'est celui Qui chacun
      sait, le livre des MAXIMES."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is just this: the book is a mirror in which we all see ourselves. This
      has made it so unpopular. It is too true. We dislike to be told of our
      faults, while we only like to be told of our neighbour's. Notwithstanding
      Rousseau's assertion, it is young men, who, before they know their own
      faults and only know their neighbours', that read and thoroughly
      appreciate Rochefoucauld.
    </p>
    <p>
      After so many varied opinions he then pleases us more and seems far truer
      than he is in reality, it is impossible to give any general conclusion of
      such distinguished writers on the subject. Each reader will form his own
      opinion of the merits of the author and his book. To some, both will seem
      deserving of the highest praise; to others both will seem deserving of the
      highest censure. The truest judgment as to the author will be found in the
      remarks of a countryman of his own, as to the book in the remarks of a
      countryman of ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the author, M. Sainte Beuve says:&mdash;"C'&eacute;tait un
      misanthrope poli, insinuant, souriant, qui pr&eacute;c&eacute;dait de bien
      peu et pr&eacute;parait avec charme l'autre MISANTHROPE."
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the book, Mr. Hallam says:&mdash;"Among the books in ancient and
      modern times which record the conclusions of observing men on the moral
      qualities of their fellows, a high place should be reserved for the Maxims
      of Rochefoucauld".

        REFLECTIONS;<br /> OR, SENTENCES AND MORAL MAXIMS
      </h2>
      <h4>
        Our virtues are most frequently but vices disguised.
      </h4>
      <p>
        [This epigraph which is the key to the system of La Rochefoucauld, is
        found in another form as No. 179 of the maxims of the first edition,
        1665, it is omitted from the 2nd and 3rd, and reappears for the first
        time in the 4th edition, in 1675, as at present, at the head of the
        Reflections.&mdash;<i>Aim&eacute; Martin.</i> Its best answer is arrived
        at by reversing the predicate and the subject, and you at once form a
        contradictory maxim equally true, our vices are most frequently but
        virtues disguised.]
      </p>
      <a name="link1" id="link1"></a><br />
      <p>
        1.&mdash;What we term virtue is often but a mass of various actions and
        divers interests, which fortune, or our own industry, manage to arrange;
        and it is not always from valour or from chastity that men are brave,
        and women chaste.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who combats bravely is not therefore brave, He dreads a death-bed like
        the meanest slave; Who reasons wisely is not therefore wise, His pride
        in reasoning, not in acting, lies." Pope, <i>Moral Essays</i>, Ep. i.
        line 115.
      </p>
      <a name="link2" id="link2"></a><br />
      <p>
        2.&mdash;Self-love is the greatest of flatterers.
      </p>
      <a name="link3" id="link3"></a><br />
      <p>
        3.&mdash;Whatever discoveries have been made in the region of self-love,
        there remain many unexplored territories there.
      </p>
      <p>
        [This is the first hint of the system the author tries to develope. He
        wishes to find in vice a motive for all our actions, but this does not
        suffice him; he is obliged to call other passions to the help of his
        system and to confound pride, vanity, interest and egotism with self
        love. This confusion destroys the unity of his principle.&mdash;<i>Aim&eacute;
        Martin</i>.]
      </p>
      <a name="link4" id="link4"></a><br />
      <p>
        4.&mdash;Self love is more cunning than the most cunning man in the
        world.
      </p>
      <a name="link5" id="link5"></a><br />
      <p>
        5.&mdash;The duration of our passions is no more dependant upon us than
        the duration of our life. [Then what becomes of free will?&mdash;<i>Aim&eacute;</i>;
        <i>Martin</i>]
      </p>
      <a name="link6" id="link6"></a><br />
      <p>
        6.&mdash;Passion often renders the most clever man a fool, and even
        sometimes renders the most foolish man clever.
      </p>
      <a name="link7" id="link7"></a><br />
      <p>
        7.&mdash;Great and striking actions which dazzle the eyes are
        represented by politicians as the effect of great designs, instead of
        which they are commonly caused by the temper and the passions. Thus the
        war between Augustus and Anthony, which is set down to the ambition they
        entertained of making themselves masters of the world, was probably but
        an effect of jealousy.
      </p>
      <a name="link8" id="link8"></a><br />
      <p>
        8.&mdash;The passions are the only advocates which always persuade. They
        are a natural art, the rules of which are infallible; and the simplest
        man with passion will be more persuasive than the most eloquent without.
      </p>
      <p>
        [See Maxim 249 which is an illustration of this.]
      </p>
      <a name="link9" id="link9"></a><br />
      <p>
        9.&mdash;The passions possess a certain injustice and self interest
        which makes it dangerous to follow them, and in reality we should
        distrust them even when they appear most trustworthy.
      </p>
      <a name="link10" id="link10"></a><br />
      <p>
        10.&mdash;In the human heart there is a perpetual generation of
        passions; so that the ruin of one is almost always the foundation of
        another.
      </p>
      <a name="link11" id="link11"></a><br />
      <p>
        11.&mdash;Passions often produce their contraries: avarice sometimes
        leads to prodigality, and prodigality to avarice; we are often obstinate
        through weakness and daring though timidity.
      </p>
      <a name="link12" id="link12"></a><br />
      <p>
        12.&mdash;Whatever care we take to conceal our passions under the
        appearances of piety and honour, they are always to be seen through
        these veils.
      </p>
      <p>
        [The 1st edition, 1665, preserves the image perhaps better&mdash;"however
        we may conceal our passions under the veil, etc., there is always some
        place where they peep out."]
      </p>
      <a name="link13" id="link13"></a><br />
      <p>
        13.&mdash;Our self love endures more impatiently the condemnation of our
        tastes than of our opinions.
      </p>
      <a name="link14" id="link14"></a><br />
      <p>
        14.&mdash;Men are not only prone to forget benefits and injuries; they
        even hate those who have obliged them, and cease to hate those who have
        injured them. The necessity of revenging an injury or of recompensing a
        benefit seems a slavery to which they are unwilling to submit.
      </p>
      <a name="link15" id="link15"></a><br />
      <p>
        15.&mdash;The clemency of Princes is often but policy to win the
        affections of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        ["So many are the advantages which monarchs gain by clemency, so greatly
        does it raise their fame and endear them to their subjects, that it is
        generally happy for them to have an opportunity of displaying it."&mdash;Montesquieu,
        <i>Esprit Des Lois, Lib. VI., C. 21.</i>]
      </p>
      <a name="link16" id="link16"></a><br />
      <p>
        16.&mdash;This clemency of which they make a merit, arises oftentimes
        from vanity, sometimes from idleness, oftentimes from fear, and almost
        always from all three combined.
      </p>
      <p>
        [La Rochefoucauld is content to paint the age in which he lived. Here
        the clemency spoken of is nothing more than an expression of the policy
        of Anne of Austria. Rochefoucauld had sacrificed all to her; even the
        favour of Cardinal Richelieu, but when she became regent she bestowed
        her favours upon those she hated; her friends were forgotten.&mdash;<i>Aim&eacute;
        Martin</i>. The reader will hereby see that the age in which the writer
        lived best interprets his maxims.]
      </p>
      <a name="link17" id="link17"></a><br />
      <p>
        17.&mdash;The moderation of those who are happy arises from the calm
        which good fortune bestows upon their temper.
      </p>
      <a name="link18" id="link18"></a><br />
      <p>
        18.&mdash;Moderation is caused by the fear of exciting the envy and
        contempt which those merit who are intoxicated with their good fortune;
        it is a vain display of our strength of mind, and in short the
        moderation of men at their greatest height is only a desire to appear
        greater than their fortune.
      </p>
      <a name="link19" id="link19"></a><br />
      <p>
        19.&mdash;We have all sufficient strength to support the misfortunes of
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        [The strongest example of this is the passage in Lucretius, lib. ii.,
        line I:&mdash; "Suave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis E terra
        magnum alterius spectare laborem."]
      </p>
      <a name="link20" id="link20"></a><br />
      <p>
        20.&mdash;The constancy of the wise is only the talent of concealing the
        agitation of their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Thus wisdom is only hypocrisy, says a commentator. This definition of
        constancy is a result of maxim 18.]
      </p>
      <a name="link21" id="link21"></a><br />
      <p>
        21.&mdash;Those who are condemned to death affect sometimes a constancy
        and contempt for death which is only the fear of facing it; so that one
        may say that this constancy and contempt are to their mind what the
        bandage is to their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        [See this thought elaborated in maxim 504.]
      </p>
      <a name="link22" id="link22"></a><br />
      <p>
        22.&mdash;Philosophy triumphs easily over past evils and future evils;
        but present evils triumph over it.
      </p>
      <a name="link23" id="link23"></a><br />
      <p>
        23.&mdash;Few people know death, we only endure it, usually from
        determination, and even from stupidity and custom; and most men only die
        because they know not how to prevent dying.
      </p>
      <a name="link24" id="link24"></a><br />
      <p>
        24.&mdash;When great men permit themselves to be cast down by the
        continuance of misfortune, they show us that they were only sustained by
        ambition, and not by their mind; so that PLUS a great vanity, heroes are
        made like other men.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Both these maxims have been rewritten and made conciser by the author;
        the variations are not worth quoting.]
      </p>
      <a name="link25" id="link25"></a><br />
      <p>
        25.&mdash;We need greater virtues to sustain good than evil fortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        ["Prosperity do{th} best discover vice, but adversity do{th} best
        discover virtue."&mdash;Lord Bacon, <i>Essays</i>{, (1625), "Of
        Adversity"}.]
      </p>
      <p>
        {The quotation wrongly had "does" for "doth".}
      </p>
      <a name="link26" id="link26"></a><br />
      <p>
        26.&mdash;Neither the sun nor death can be looked at without winking.
      </p>
      <a name="link27" id="link27"></a><br />
      <p>
        27.&mdash;People are often vain of their passions, even of the worst,
        but envy is a passion so timid and shame-faced that no one ever dare
        avow her.
      </p>
      <a name="link28" id="link28"></a><br />
      <p>
        28.&mdash;Jealousy is in a manner just and reasonable, as it tends to
        preserve a good which belongs, or which we believe belongs to us, on the
        other hand envy is a fury which cannot endure the happiness of others.
      </p>
      <a name="link29" id="link29"></a><br />
      <p>
        29.&mdash;The evil that we do does not attract to us so much persecution
        and hatred as our good qualities.
      </p>
      <a name="link30" id="link30"></a><br />
      <p>
        30.&mdash;We have more strength than will; and it is often merely for an
        excuse we say things are impossible.
      </p>
      <a name="link31" id="link31"></a><br />
      <p>
        31.&mdash;If we had no faults we should not take so much pleasure in
        noting those of others.
      </p>
      <a name="link32" id="link32"></a><br />
      <p>
        32.&mdash;Jealousy lives upon doubt; and comes to an end or becomes a
        fury as soon as it passes from doubt to certainty.
      </p>
      <a name="link33" id="link33"></a><br />
      <p>
        33.&mdash;Pride indemnifies itself and loses nothing even when it casts
        away vanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        [See maxim 450, where the author states, what we take from our other
        faults we add to our pride.]
      </p>
      <a name="link34" id="link34"></a><br />
      <p>
        34.&mdash;If we had no pride we should not complain of that of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        ["The proud are ever most provoked by pride."&mdash;Cowper, <i>Conversation</i>
        160.]
      </p>
      <a name="link35" id="link35"></a><br />
      <p>
        35.&mdash;Pride is much the same in all men, the only difference is the
        method and manner of showing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ["Pride bestowed on all a common friend."&mdash;Pope, <i>Essay On Man,
        Ep.</i> ii., line 273.]
      </p>
      <a name="link36" id="link36"></a><br />
      <p>
        36.&mdash;It would seem that nature, which has so wisely ordered the
        organs of our body for our happiness, has also given us pride to spare
        us the mortification of knowing our imperfections.
      </p>
      <a name="link37" id="link37"></a><br />
      <p>
        37.&mdash;Pride has a larger part than goodness in our remonstrances
        with those who commit faults, and we reprove them not so much to correct
        as to persuade them that we ourselves are free from faults.
      </p>
      <a name="link38" id="link38"></a><br />

        to what related to private conduct no one was ever the better for
        advice.' But upon further examination I have resolved with myself that
        the maxim might be admitted without any violent prejudice to mankind.
        For in the manner advice was generally given there was no reason I
        thought to wonder it should be so ill received, something there was
        which strangely inverted the case, and made the giver to be the only
        gainer. For by what I could observe in many occurrences of our lives,
        that which we called giving advice was properly taking an occasion to
        show our own wisdom at another's expense. On the other side to be
        instructed or to receive advice on the terms usually prescribed to us
        was little better than tamely to afford another the occasion of raising
        himself a character from our defects."&mdash;Lord Shaftesbury, <i>Characteristics</i>,

        215.&mdash;Perfect bravery and sheer cowardice are two extremes rarely
        found. The space between them is vast, and embraces all other sorts of
        courage. The difference between them is not less than between faces and
        tempers. Men will freely expose themselves at the beginning of an
        action, and relax and be easily discouraged if it should last. Some are
        content to satisfy worldly honour, and beyond that will do little else.
        Some are not always equally masters of their timidity. Others allow
        themselves to be overcome by panic; others charge because they dare not
        remain at their posts. Some may be found whose courage is strengthened
        by small perils, which prepare them to face greater dangers. Some will
        dare a sword cut and flinch from a bullet; others dread bullets little
        and fear to fight with swords. These varied kinds of courage agree in
        this, that night, by increasing fear and concealing gallant or cowardly
        actions, allows men to spare themselves. There is even a more general
        discretion to be observed, for we meet with no man who does all he would
        have done if he were assured of getting off scot-free; so that it is
        certain that the fear of death does somewhat subtract from valour.

      <p>
        233.&mdash;In afflictions there are various kinds of hypocrisy. In one,
        under the pretext of weeping for one dear to us we bemoan ourselves; we
        regret her good opinion of us, we deplore the loss of our comfort, our
        pleasure, our consideration. Thus the dead have the credit of tears shed
        for the living. I affirm 'tis a kind of hypocrisy which in these
        afflictions deceives itself. There is another kind not so innocent
        because it imposes on all the world, that is the grief of those who
        aspire to the glory of a noble and immortal sorrow. After Time, which
        absorbs all, has obliterated what sorrow they had, they still
        obstinately obtrude their tears, their sighs their groans, they wear a
        solemn face, and try to persuade others by all their acts, that their
        grief will end only with their life. This sad and distressing vanity is
        commonly found in ambitious women. As their sex closes to them all paths
        to glory, they strive to render themselves celebrated by showing an
        inconsolable affliction. There is yet another kind of tears arising from
        but small sources, which flow easily and cease as easily. One weeps to

        desirous to possess, and often foregoes great future advantages for
        small present interests. The avaricious man, on the other hand, mistakes
        present advantages for the great expectations of the future. Both desire
        to possess and enjoy. But the miser possesses and enjoys nothing but the
        pleasure of possessing; he risks nothing, gives nothing, hopes nothing,

        504.&mdash;Thus having treated of the hollowness of so many apparent
        virtues, it is but just to say something on the hollowness of the
        contempt for death. I allude to that contempt of death which the heathen
        boasted they derived from their unaided understanding, without the hope
        of a future state. There is a difference between meeting death with
        courage and despising it. The first is common enough, the last I think
        always feigned. Yet everything that could be has been written to
        persuade us that death is no evil, and the weakest of men, equally with
        the bravest, have given many noble examples on which to found such an
        opinion, still I do not think that any man of good sense has ever yet
        believed in it. And the pains we take to persuade others as well as
        ourselves amply show that the task is far from easy. For many reasons we
        may be disgusted with life, but for none may we despise it. Not even
        those who commit suicide regard it as a light matter, and are as much
        alarmed and startled as the rest of the world if death meets them in a
        different way than the one they have selected. The difference we observe
        in the courage of so great a number of brave men, is from meeting death
        in a way different from what they imagined, when it shows itself nearer
        at one time than at another. Thus it ultimately happens that having
        despised death when they were ignorant of it, they dread it when they
        become acquainted with it. If we could avoid seeing it with all its
        surroundings, we might perhaps believe that it was not the greatest of
        evils. The wisest and bravest are those who take the best means to avoid
        reflecting on it, as every man who sees it in its real light regards it
        as dreadful. The necessity of dying created all the constancy of
        philosophers. They thought it but right to go with a good grace when
        they could not avoid going, and being unable to prolong their lives
        indefinitely, nothing remained but to build an immortal reputation, and
        to save from the general wreck all that could be saved. To put a good
        face upon it, let it suffice, not to say all that we think to ourselves,
        but rely more on our nature than on our fallible reason, which might
        make us think we could approach death with indifference. The glory of
        dying with courage, the hope of being regretted, the desire to leave
        behind us a good reputation, the assurance of being enfranchised from
        the miseries of life and being no longer dependent on the wiles of
        fortune, are resources which should not be passed over. But we must not
        regard them as infallible. They should affect us in the same proportion
        as a single shelter affects those who in war storm a fortress. At a
        distance they think it may afford cover, but when near they find it only
        a feeble protection. It is only deceiving ourselves to imagine that
        death, when near, will seem the same as at a distance, or that our
        feelings, which are merely weaknesses, are naturally so strong that they
        will not suffer in an attack of the rudest of trials. It is equally as
        absurd to try the effect of self-esteem and to think it will enable us
        to count as naught what will of necessity destroy it. And the mind in
        which we trust to find so many resources will be far too weak in the
        struggle to persuade us in the way we wish. For it is this which betrays
        us so frequently, and which, instead of filling us with contempt of
        death, serves but to show us all that is frightful and fearful. The most
        it can do for us is to persuade us to avert our gaze and fix it on other
        objects. Cato and Brutus each selected noble ones. A lackey sometime ago
        contented himself by dancing on the scaffold when he was about to be
        broken on the wheel. So however diverse the motives they but realize the
        same result. For the rest it is a fact that whatever difference there
        may be between the peer and the peasant, we have constantly seen both
        the one and the other meet death with the same composure. Still there is
        always this difference, that the contempt the peer shows for death is
        but the love of fame which hides death from his sight; in the peasant it
        is but the result of his limited vision that hides from him the extent
        of the evil, end leaves him free to reflect on other things.

      THE FIRST SUPPLEMENT

    <p>
      <a name="linkI" id="linkI">I</a>.&mdash;Self-love is the love <i>of</i>
      self, and of all things <i>for</i> self. It makes men self-worshippers,
      and if fortune permits them, causes them to tyrannize over others; it is
      never quiet when out of itself, and only rests upon other subjects as a
      bee upon flowers, to extract from them its proper food. Nothing is so
      headstrong as its desires, nothing so well concealed as its designs,
      nothing so skilful as its management; its suppleness is beyond
      description; its changes surpass those of the metamorphoses, its
      refinements those of chemistry. We can neither plumb the depths nor pierce
      the shades of its recesses. Therein it is hidden from the most far-seeing
      eyes, therein it takes a thousand imperceptible folds. There it is often
      to itself invisible; it there conceives, there nourishes and rears,
      without being aware of it, numberless loves and hatreds, some so monstrous
      that when they are brought to light it disowns them, and cannot resolve to
      avow them. In the night which covers it are born the ridiculous
      persuasions it has of itself, thence come its errors, its ignorance, its
      silly mistakes; thence it is led to believe that its passions which sleep
      are dead, and to think that it has lost all appetite for that of which it
      is sated. But this thick darkness which conceals it from itself does not
      hinder it from seeing that perfectly which is out of itself; and in this
      it resembles our eyes which behold all, and yet cannot set their own
      forms. In fact, in great concerns and important matters when the violence
      of its desires summons all its attention, it sees, feels, hears, imagines,
      suspects, penetrates, divines all: so that we might think that each of its
      passions had a magic power proper to it. Nothing is so close and strong as
      its attachments, which, in sight of the extreme misfortunes which threaten
      it, it vainly attempts to break. Yet sometimes it effects that without
      trouble and quickly, which it failed to do with its whole power and in the
      course of years, whence we may fairly conclude that it is by itself that
      its desires are inflamed, rather than by the beauty and merit of its
      objects, that its own taste embellishes and heightens them; that it is
      itself the game it pursues, and that it follows eagerly when it runs after
      that upon which itself is eager. It is made up of contraries. It is
      imperious and obedient, sincere and false, piteous and cruel, timid and
      bold. It has different desires according to the diversity of temperaments,
      which turn and fix it sometimes upon riches, sometimes on pleasures. It
      changes according to our age, our fortunes, and our hopes; it is quite
      indifferent whether it has many or one, because it can split itself into
      many portions, and unite in one as it pleases. It is inconstant, and
      besides the changes which arise from strange causes it has an infinity
      born of itself, and of its own substance. It is inconstant through
      inconstancy, of lightness, love, novelty, lassitude and distaste. It is
      capricious, and one sees it sometimes work with intense eagerness and with
      incredible labour to obtain things of little use to it which are even
      hurtful, but which it pursues because it wishes for them. It is silly, and
      often throws its whole application on the utmost frivolities. It finds all
      its pleasure in the dullest matters, and places its pride in the most
      contemptible. It is seen in all states of life, and in all conditions; it
      lives everywhere and upon everything; it subsists on nothing; it
      accommodates itself either to things or to the want of them; it goes over
      to those who are at war with it, enters into their designs, and, this is
      wonderful, it, with them, hates even itself; it conspires for its own
      loss, it works towards its own ruin&mdash;in fact, caring only to exist,
      and providing that it may <i>be</i>, it will be its own enemy! We must
      therefore not be surprised if it is sometimes united to the rudest
      austerity, and if it enters so boldly into partnership to destroy her,
      because when it is rooted out in one place it re-establishes itself in
      another. When it fancies that it abandons its pleasure it merely changes
      or suspends its enjoyment. When even it is conquered in its full flight,
      we find that it triumphs in its own defeat. Here then is the picture of
      self-love whereof the whole of our life is but one long agitation. The sea
      is its living image; and in the flux and reflux of its continuous waves
      there is a faithful expression of the stormy succession of its thoughts
      and of its eternal motion. (Edition of 1665, No. 1.)

      [This gave occasion to Swift's celebrated "Verses on his own Death." The
      four first are quoted opposite the title, then follow these lines:&mdash;
      "This maxim more than all the rest, Is thought too base for human breast;
      In all distresses of our friends, We first consult our private ends; While
      nature kindly bent to ease us, Points out some circumstance to please us."
    </p>
    <p>
      See also Chesterfield's defence of this in his 129th letter; "they who
      know the deception and wickedness of the human heart will not be either
      romantic or blind enough to deny what Rochefoucauld and Swift have
      affirmed as a general truth."]

      <a name="linkXVII" id="linkXVII">XVII</a>.&mdash;As if it was not
      sufficient that self-love should have the power to change itself, it has
      added that of changing other objects, and this it does in a very
      astonishing manner; for not only does it so well disguise them that it is
      itself deceived, but it even changes the state and nature of things. Thus,
      when a female is adverse to us, and she turns her hate and persecution
      against us, self-love pronounces on her actions with all the severity of
      justice; it exaggerates the faults till they are enormous, and looks at
      her good qualities in so disadvantageous a light that they become more
      displeasing than her faults. If however the same female becomes favourable
      to us, or certain of our interests reconcile her to us, our sole self
      interest gives her back the lustre which our hatred deprived her of. The
      bad qualities become effaced, the good ones appear with a redoubled
      advantage; we even summon all our indulgence to justify the war she has
      made upon us. Now although all passions prove this truth, that of love
      exhibits it most clearly; for we may see a lover moved with rage by the
      neglect or the infidelity of her whom he loves, and meditating the utmost
      vengeance that his passion can inspire. Nevertheless as soon as the sight
      of his beloved has calmed the fury of his movements, his passion holds
      that beauty innocent; he only accuses himself, he condemns his
      condemnations, and by the miraculous power of selflove, he whitens the
      blackest actions of his mistress, and takes from her all crime to lay it
      on himself.

      {The date of the previous two maxims is incorrectly cited as 1665 in the
      text. I found this date immediately suspect because the translators'
      introduction states that the 1665 edition only had 316 maxims. In fact,
      the two maxims only appeared in the fourth of the first five editions
      (1674).}

      self-love, in as much as when the body deprived of its soul is without
      sight, feeling or knowledge, without thought or movement, so self-love,
      riven so to speak from its interest, neither sees, nor hears, nor smells,
      nor moves; thus it is that the same man who will run over land and sea for
      his own interest becomes suddenly paralyzed when engaged for that of
      others; from this arises that sudden dulness and, as it were, death, with
      which we afflict those to whom we speak of our own matters; from this also
      their sudden resurrection when in our narrative we relate something
      concerning them; from this we find in our conversations and business that
      a man becomes dull or bright just as his own interest is near to him or
      distant from him. (<i>Letter To Madame De Sabl&eacute;, Ms., Fol</i>.

      make a wise man happy; nothing can make a fool content; that is why most

      REFLECTIONS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS, BY THE DUKE DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a name="linkR.I" id="linkR.I"></a>
    </p>
    <h3>
      I. On Confidence.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Though sincerity and confidence have many points of resemblance, they have
      yet many points of difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerity is an openness of heart, which shows us what we are, a love of
      truth, a dislike to deception, a wish to compensate our faults and to
      lessen them by the merit of confessing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confidence leaves us less liberty, its rules are stricter, it requires
      more prudence and reticence, and we are not always free to give it. It
      relates not only to ourselves, since our interests are often mixed up with
      those of others; it requires great delicacy not to expose our friends in
      exposing ourselves, not to draw upon their goodness to enhance the value
      of what we give.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confidence always pleases those who receive it. It is a tribute we pay to
      their merit, a deposit we commit to their trust, a pledge which gives them
      a claim upon us, a kind of dependence to which we voluntarily submit. I do
      not wish from what I have said to depreciate confidence, so necessary to
      man. It is in society the link between acquaintance and friendship. I only
      wish to state its limits to make it true and real. I would that it was
      always sincere, always discreet, and that it had neither weakness nor
      interest. I know it is hard to place proper limits on being taken into all
      our friends' confidence, and taking them into all ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most frequently we make confidants from vanity, a love of talking, a wish
      to win the confidence of others, and make an exchange of secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some may have a motive for confiding in us, towards whom we have no motive
      for confiding. With them we discharge the obligation in keeping their
      secrets and trusting them with small confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others whose fidelity we know trust nothing to us, but we confide in them
      by choice and inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should hide from them nothing that concerns us, we should always show
      them with equal truth, our virtues and our vices, without exaggerating the
      one or diminishing the other. We should make it a rule never to have half
      confidences. They always embarrass those who give them, and dissatisfy
      those who receive them. They shed an uncertain light on what we want
      hidden, increase curiosity, entitling the recipients to know more, giving
      them leave to consider themselves free to talk of what they have guessed.
      It is far safer and more honest to tell nothing than to be silent when we
      have begun to tell. There are other rules to be observed in matters
      confided to us, all are important, to all prudence and trust are
      essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone agrees that a secret should be kept intact, but everyone does not
      agree as to the nature and importance of secresy. Too often we consult
      ourselves as to what we should say, what we should leave unsaid. There are
      few permanent secrets, and the scruple against revealing them will not
      last for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      With those friends whose truth we know we have the closest intimacy. They
      have always spoken unreservedly to us, we should always do the same to
      them. They know our habits and connexions, and see too clearly not to
      perceive the slightest change. They may have elsewhere learnt what we have
      promised not to tell. It is not in our power to tell them what has been
      entrusted to us, though it might tend to their interest to know it. We
      feel as confident of them as of ourselves, and we are reduced to the hard
      fate of losing their friendship, which is dear to us, or of being
      faithless as regards a secret. This is doubtless the hardest test of
      fidelity, but it should not move an honest man; it is then that he can
      sacrifice himself to others. His first duty is to rigidly keep his trust
      in its entirety. He should not only control and guard his and his voice,
      but even his lighter talk, so that nothing be seen in his conversation or
      manner that could direct the curiosity of others towards that which he
      wishes to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have often need of strength and prudence wherewith to oppose the
      exigencies of most of our friends who make a claim on our confidence, and
      seek to know all about us. We should never allow them to acquire this
      unexceptionable right. There are accidents and circumstances which do not
      fall in their cognizance; if they complain, we should endure their
      complaints and excuse ourselves with gentleness, but if they are still
      unreasonable, we should sacrifice their friendship to our duty, and choose
      between two inevitable evils, the one reparable, the other irreparable.

      II. On Difference of Character.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Although all the qualities of mind may be united in a great genius, yet
      there are some which are special and peculiar to him; his views are
      unlimited; he always acts uniformly and with the same activity; he sees
      distant objects as if present; he comprehends and grasps the greatest,
      sees and notices the smallest matters; his thoughts are elevated, broad,
      just and intelligible. Nothing escapes his observation, and he often finds
      truth in spite of the obscurity that hides her from others.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lofty mind always thinks nobly, it easily creates vivid, agreeable, and
      natural fancies, places them in their best light, clothes them with all
      appropriate adornments, studies others' tastes, and clears away from its
      own thoughts all that is useless and disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clever, pliant, winning mind knows how to avoid and overcome
      difficulties. Bending easily to what it wants, it understands the
      inclination and temper it is dealing with, and by managing their interests
      it advances and establishes its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      A well regulated mind sees all things as they should be seen, appraises
      them at their proper value, turns them to its own advantage, and adheres
      firmly to its own opinions as it knows all their force and weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A difference exists between a working mind and a business-like mind. We
      can undertake business without turning it to our own interest. Some are
      clever only in what does not concern them, and the reverse in all that
      does. There are others again whose cleverness is limited to their own
      business, and who know how to turn everything to their own advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to have a serious turn of mind, and yet to talk pleasantly
      and cheerfully. This class of mind is suited to all persons in all times
      of life. Young persons have usually a cheerful and satirical turn,
      untempered by seriousness, thus often making themselves disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      No part is easier to play than that of being always pleasant; and the
      applause we sometimes receive in censuring others is not worth being
      exposed to the chance of offending them when they are out of temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satire is at once the most agreeable and most dangerous of mental
      qualities. It always pleases when it is refined, but we always fear those
      who use it too much, yet satire should be allowed when unmixed with spite,
      and when the person satirised can join in the satire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unfortunate to have a satirical turn without affecting to be pleased
      or without loving to jest. It requires much adroitness to continue
      satirical without falling into one of these extremes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raillery is a kind of mirth which takes possession of the imagination, and
      shows every object in an absurd light; wit combines more or less softness
      or harshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a kind of refined and flattering raillery that only hits the
      faults that persons admit, which understands how to hide the praise it
      gives under the appearance of blame, and shows the good while feigning a
      wish to hide it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An acute mind and a cunning mind are very dissimilar. The first always
      pleases; it is unfettered, it perceives the most delicate and sees the
      most imperceptible matters. A cunning spirit never goes straight, it
      endeavours to secure its object by byeways and short cuts. This conduct is
      soon found out, it always gives rise to distrust and never reaches
      greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a difference between an ardent and a brilliant mind, a fiery
      spirit travels further and faster, while a brilliant mind is sparkling,
      attractive, accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentleness of mind is an easy and accommodating manner which always
      pleases when not insipid.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mind full of details devotes itself to the management and regulation of
      the smallest particulars it meets with. This distinction is usually
      limited to little matters, yet it is not absolutely incompatible with
      greatness, and when these two qualities are united in the same mind they
      raise it infinitely above others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression "<i>Bel Esprit</i>" is much perverted, for all that one can
      say of the different kinds of mind meet together in the "<i>Bel Esprit</i>."
      Yet as the epithet is bestowed on an infinite number of bad poets and
      tedious authors, it is more often used to ridicule than to praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are yet many other epithets for the mind which mean the same thing,
      the difference lies in the tone and manner of saying them, but as tones
      and manner cannot appear in writing I shall not go into distinctions I
      cannot explain. Custom explains this in saying that a man has wit, has
      much wit, that he is a great wit; there are tones and manners which make
      all the difference between phrases which seem all alike on paper, and yet
      express a different order of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we say that a man has only one kind of wit, that he has several, that
      he has every variety of wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can be a fool with much wit, and one need not be a fool even with very
      little wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have much mind is a doubtful expression. It may mean every class of
      mind that can be mentioned, it may mean none in particular. It may mean
      that he talks sensibly while he acts foolishly. We may have a mind, but a
      narrow one. A mind may be fitted for some things, not for others. We may
      have a large measure of mind fitted for nothing, and one is often
      inconvenienced with much mind; still of this kind of mind we may say that
      it is sometimes pleasing in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the gifts of the mind are infinite, they can, it seems to me, be
      thus classified.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some so beautiful that everyone can see and feel their beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some lovely, it is true, but which are wearisome.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some which are lovely, which all the world admire, but without
      knowing why.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some so refined and delicate that few are capable even of
      remarking all their beauties.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are others which, though imperfect, yet are produced with such
      skill, and sustained and managed with such sense and grace, that they even
      deserve to be admired.

    <h3>
      III. On Taste.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some persons have more wit than taste, others have more taste than wit.
      There is greater vanity and caprice in taste than in wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word taste has different meanings, which it is easy to mistake. There
      is a difference between the taste which in certain objects has an
      attraction for us, and the taste that makes us understand and distinguish
      the qualities we judge by.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may like a comedy without having a sufficiently fine and delicate taste
      to criticise it accurately. Some tastes lead us imperceptibly to objects,
      from which others carry us away by their force or intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some persons have bad taste in everything, others have bad taste only in
      some things, but a correct and good taste in matters within their
      capacity. Some have peculiar taste, which they know to be bad, but which
      they still follow. Some have a doubtful taste, and let chance decide,
      their indecision makes them change, and they are affected with pleasure or
      weariness on their friends' judgment. Others are always prejudiced, they
      are the slaves of their tastes, which they adhere to in everything. Some
      know what is good, and are horrified at what is not; their opinions are
      clear and true, and they find the reason for their taste in their mind and
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some have a species of instinct (the source of which they are ignorant
      of), and decide all questions that come before them by its aid, and always
      decide rightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      These follow their taste more than their intelligence, because they do not
      permit their temper and self-love to prevail over their natural
      discernment. All they do is in harmony, all is in the same spirit. This
      harmony makes them decide correctly on matters, and form a correct
      estimate of their value. But speaking generally there are few who have a
      taste fixed and independent of that of their friends, they follow example
      and fashion which generally form the standard of taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the diversities of taste that we discern, it is very rare and
      almost impossible to meet with that sort of good taste that knows how to
      set a price on the particular, and yet understands the right value that
      should be placed on all. Our knowledge is too limited, and that correct
      discernment of good qualities which goes to form a correct judgment is too
      seldom to be met with except in regard to matters that do not concern us.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards ourselves our taste has not this all-important discernment.
      Preoccupation, trouble, all that concern us, present it to us in another
      aspect. We do not see with the same eyes what does and what does not
      relate to us. Our taste is guided by the bent of our self-love and temper,
      which supplies us with new views which we adapt to an infinite number of
      changes and uncertainties. Our taste is no longer our own, we cease to
      control it, without our consent it changes, and the same objects appear to
      us in such divers aspects that ultimately we fail to perceive what we have
      seen and heard.

    <h3>
      IV. On Society.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In speaking of society my plan is not to speak of friendship, for, though
      they have some connection, they are yet very different. The former has
      more in it of greatness and humility, and the greatest merit of the latter
      is to resemble the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the present I shall speak of that particular kind of intercourse that
      gentlemen should have with each other. It would be idle to show how far
      society is essential to men: all seek for it, and all find it, but few
      adopt the method of making it pleasant and lasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone seeks to find his pleasure and his advantage at the expense of
      others. We prefer ourselves always to those with whom we intend to live,
      and they almost always perceive the preference. It is this which disturbs
      and destroys society. We should discover a means to hide this love of
      selection since it is too ingrained in us to be in our power to destroy.
      We should make our pleasure that of other persons, to humour, never to
      wound their self-love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mind has a great part to do in so great a work, but it is not merely
      sufficient for us to guide it in the different courses it should hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agreement we meet between minds would not keep society together for
      long if she was not governed and sustained by good sense, temper, and by
      the consideration which ought to exist between persons who have to live
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sometimes happens that persons opposite in temper and mind become
      united. They doubtless hold together for different reasons, which cannot
      last for long. Society may subsist between those who are our inferiors by
      birth or by personal qualities, but those who have these advantages should
      not abuse them. They should seldom let it be perceived that they serve to
      instruct others. They should let their conduct show that they, too, have
      need to be guided and led by reason, and accommodate themselves as far as
      possible to the feeling and the interests of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make society pleasant, it is essential that each should retain his
      freedom of action. A man should not see himself, or he should see himself
      without dependence, and at the same time amuse himself. He should have the
      power of separating himself without that separation bringing any change on
      the society. He should have the power to pass by one and the other, if he
      does not wish to expose himself to occasional embarrassments; and he
      should remember that he is often bored when he believes he has not the
      power even to bore. He should share in what he believes to be the
      amusement of persons with whom he wishes to live, but he should not always
      be liable to the trouble of providing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complaisance is essential in society, but it should have its limits, it
      becomes a slavery when it is extreme. We should so render a free consent,
      that in following the opinion of our friends they should believe that they
      follow ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should readily excuse our friends when their faults are born with them,
      and they are less than their good qualities. We should often avoid to show
      what they have said, and what they have left unsaid. We should try to make
      them perceive their faults, so as to give them the merit of correcting
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a kind of politeness which is necessary in the intercourse among
      gentlemen, it makes them comprehend badinage, and it keeps them from using
      and employing certain figures of speech, too rude and unrefined, which are
      often used thoughtlessly when we hold to our opinion with too much warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intercourse of gentlemen cannot subsist without a certain kind of
      confidence; this should be equal on both sides. Each should have an
      appearance of sincerity and of discretion which never causes the fear of
      anything imprudent being said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There should be some variety in wit. Those who have only one kind of wit
      cannot please for long unless they can take different roads, and not both
      use the same talents, thus adding to the pleasure of society, and keeping
      the same harmony that different voices and different instruments should
      observe in music; and as it is detrimental to the quiet of society, that
      many persons should have the same interests, it is yet as necessary for it
      that their interests should not be different.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should anticipate what can please our friends, find out how to be
      useful to them so as to exempt them from annoyance, and when we cannot
      avert evils, seem to participate in them, insensibly obliterate without
      attempting to destroy them at a blow, and place agreeable objects in their
      place, or at least such as will interest them. We should talk of subjects
      that concern them, but only so far as they like, and we should take great
      care where we draw the line. There is a species of politeness, and we may
      say a similar species of humanity, which does not enter too quickly into
      the recesses of the heart. It often takes pains to allow us to see all
      that our friends know, while they have still the advantage of not knowing
      to the full when we have penetrated the depth of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the intercourse between gentlemen at once gives them familiarity and
      furnishes them with an infinite number of subjects on which to talk
      freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few persons have sufficient tact and good sense fairly to appreciate many
      matters that are essential to maintain society. We desire to turn away at
      a certain point, but we do not want to be mixed up in everything, and we
      fear to know all kinds of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we should stand at a certain distance to view objects, so we should
      also stand at a distance to observe society; each has its proper point of
      view from which it should be regarded. It is quite right that it should
      not be looked at too closely, for there is hardly a man who in all matters
      allows himself to be seen as he really is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkR.V" id="linkR.V"></a>
    </p>
    <h3>
      V. On Conversation.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The reason why so few persons are agreeable in conversation is that each
      thinks more of what he desires to say, than of what the others say, and
      that we make bad listeners when we want to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it is necessary to listen to those who talk, we should give them the
      time they want, and let them say even senseless things; never contradict
      or interrupt them; on the contrary, we should enter into their mind and
      taste, illustrate their meaning, praise anything they say that deserves
      praise, and let them see we praise more from our choice than from
      agreement with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To please others we should talk on subjects they like and that interest
      them, avoid disputes upon indifferent matters, seldom ask questions, and
      never let them see that we pretend to be better informed than they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should talk in a more or less serious manner, and upon more or less
      abstruse subjects, according to the temper and understanding of the
      persons we talk with, and readily give them the advantage of deciding
      without obliging them to answer when they are not anxious to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having in this way fulfilled the duties of politeness, we can speak
      our opinions to our listeners when we find an opportunity without a sign
      of presumption or opinionatedness. Above all things we should avoid often
      talking of ourselves and giving ourselves as an example; nothing is more
      tiresome than a man who quotes himself for everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot give too great study to find out the manner and the capacity of
      those with whom we talk, so as to join in the conversation of those who
      have more than ourselves without hurting by this preference the wishes or
      interests of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we should modestly use all the modes abovementioned to show our
      thoughts to them, and make them, if possible, believe that we take our
      ideas from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should never say anything with an air of authority, nor show any
      superiority of mind. We should avoid far-fetched expressions, expressions
      hard or forced, and never let the words be grander than the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not wrong to retain our opinions if they are reasonable, but we
      should yield to reason, wherever she appears and from whatever side she
      comes, she alone should govern our opinions, we should follow her without
      opposing the opinions of others, and without seeming to ignore what they
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is dangerous to seek to be always the leader of the conversation, and
      to push a good argument too hard, when we have found one. Civility often
      hides half its understanding, and when it meets with an opinionated man
      who defends the bad side, spares him the disgrace of giving way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are sure to displease when we speak too long and too often of one
      subject, and when we try to turn the conversation upon subjects that we
      think more instructive than others, we should enter indifferently upon
      every subject that is agreeable to others, stopping where they wish, and
      avoiding all they do not agree with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every kind of conversation, however witty it may be, is not equally fitted
      for all clever persons; we should select what is to their taste and
      suitable to their condition, their sex, their talents, and also choose the
      time to say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should observe the place, the occasion, the temper in which we find the
      person who listens to us, for if there is much art in speaking to the
      purpose, there is no less in knowing when to be silent. There is an
      eloquent silence which serves to approve or to condemn, there is a silence
      of discretion and of respect. In a word, there is a tone, an air, a
      manner, which renders everything in conversation agreeable or
      disagreeable, refined or vulgar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is given to few persons to keep this secret well. Those who lay
      down rules too often break them, and the safest we are able to give is to
      listen much, to speak little, and to say nothing that will ever give
      ground for regret.

    <h3>
      VI. Falsehood.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We are false in different ways. There are some men who are false from
      wishing always to appear what they are not. There are some who have better
      faith, who are born false, who deceive themselves, and who never see
      themselves as they really are; to some is given a true understanding and a
      false taste, others have a false understanding and some correctness in
      taste; there are some who have not any falsity either in taste or mind.
      These last are very rare, for to speak generally, there is no one who has
      not some falseness in some corner of his mind or his taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes this falseness so universal, is that as our qualities are
      uncertain and confused, so too, are our tastes; we do not see things
      exactly as they are, we value them more or less than they are worth, and
      do not bring them into unison with ourselves in a manner which suits them
      or suits our condition or qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mistake gives rise to an infinite number of falsities in the taste
      and in the mind. Our self-love is flattered by all that presents itself to
      us under the guise of good.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as there are many kinds of good which affect our vanity and our
      temper, so they are often followed from custom or advantage. We follow
      because the others follow, without considering that the same feeling ought
      not to be equally embarrassing to all kinds of persons, and that it should
      attach itself more or less firmly, according as persons agree more or less
      with those who follow them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dread still more to show falseness in taste than in mind. Gentleness
      should approve without prejudice what deserves to be approved, follow what
      deserves to be followed, and take offence at nothing. But there should be
      great distinction and great accuracy. We should distinguish between what
      is good in the abstract and what is good for ourselves, and always follow
      in reason the natural inclination which carries us towards matters that
      please us.
    </p>
    <p>
      If men only wished to excel by the help of their own talents, and in
      following their duty, there would be nothing false in their taste or in
      their conduct. They would show what they were, they would judge matters by
      their lights, and they would attract by their reason. There would be a
      discernment in their views, in their sentiments, their taste would be
      true, it would come to them direct, and not from others, they would follow
      from choice and not from habit or chance. If we are false in admiring what
      should not be admired, it is oftener from envy that we affix a value to
      qualities which are good in themselves, but which do not become us. A
      magistrate is false when he flatters himself he is brave, and that he will
      be able to be bold in certain cases. He should be as firm and stedfast in
      a plot which ought to be stifled without fear of being false, as he would
      be false and absurd in fighting a duel about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman may like science, but all sciences are not suitable for her, and
      the doctrines of certain sciences never become her, and when applied by
      her are always false.

      We should allow reason and good sense to fix the value of things, they
      should determine our taste and give things the merit they deserve, and the
      importance it is fitting we should give them. But nearly all men are
      deceived in the price and in the value, and in these mistakes there is
      always a kind of falseness.

    <h3>
      VII. On Air and Manner.
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is an air which belongs to the figure and talents of each
      individual; we always lose it when we abandon it to assume another.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should try to find out what air is natural to us and never abandon it,
      but make it as perfect as we can. This is the reason that the majority of
      children please. It is because they are wrapt up in the air and manner
      nature has given them, and are ignorant of any other. They are changed and
      corrupted when they quit infancy, they think they should imitate what they
      see, and they are not altogether able to imitate it. In this imitation
      there is always something of falsity and uncertainty. They have nothing
      settled in their manner and opinions. Instead of being in reality what
      they want to appear, they seek to appear what they are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      All men want to be different, and to be greater than they are; they seek
      for an air other than their own, and a mind different from what they
      possess; they take their style and manner at chance. They make experiments
      upon themselves without considering that what suits one person will not
      suit everyone, that there is no universal rule for taste or manners, and
      that there are no good copies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few men, nevertheless, can have unison in many matters without being a
      copy of each other, if each follow his natural turn of mind. But in
      general a person will not wholly follow it. He loves to imitate. We often
      imitate the same person without perceiving it, and we neglect our own good
      qualities for the good qualities of others, which generally do not suit
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not pretend, from what I say, that each should so wrap himself up in
      himself as not to be able to follow example, or to add to his own, useful
      and serviceable habits, which nature has not given him. Arts and sciences
      may be proper for the greater part of those who are capable for them. Good
      manners and politeness are proper for all the world. But, yet acquired
      qualities should always have a certain agreement and a certain union with
      our own natural qualities, which they imperceptibly extend and increase.
      We are elevated to a rank and dignity above ourselves. We are often
      engaged in a new profession for which nature has not adapted us. All these
      conditions have each an air which belong to them, but which does not
      always agree with our natural manner. This change of our fortune often
      changes our air and our manners, and augments the air of dignity, which is
      always false when it is too marked, and when it is not united and
      amalgamated with that which nature has given us. We should unite and blend
      them together, and thus render them such that they can never be separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should not speak of all subjects in one tone and in the same manner. We
      do not march at the head of a regiment as we walk on a promenade; and we
      should use the same style in which we should naturally speak of different
      things in the same way, with the same difference as we should walk, but
      always naturally, and as is suitable, either at the head of a regiment or
      on a promenade. There are some who are not content to abandon the air and
      manner natural to them to assume those of the rank and dignities to which
      they have arrived. There are some who assume prematurely the air of the
      dignities and rank to which they aspire. How many lieutenantgenerals
      assume to be marshals of France, how many barristers vainly repeat the
      style of the Chancellor and how many female citizens give themselves the
      airs of duchesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what we are most often vexed at is that no one knows how to conform
      his air and manners with his appearance, nor his style and words with his
      thoughts and sentiments, that every one forgets himself and how far he is
      insensibly removed from the truth. Nearly every one falls into this fault
      in some way. No one has an ear sufficiently fine to mark perfectly this
      kind of cadence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands of people with good qualities are displeasing; thousands
      pleasing with far less abilities, and why? Because the first wish to
      appear to be what they are not, the second are what they appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the advantages or disadvantages that we have received from nature
      please in proportion as we know the air, the style, the manner, the
      sentiments that coincide with our condition and our appearance, and
      displease in the proportion they are removed from that point.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
