    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION OF 1848.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Logic of the Schools, however indispensable in its place, fails to
      meet half the common want in daily life. The Logic of the Schools begins
      with the <i>management</i> of the premises of an argument; there is,
      however, a more practical lesson to be learned in beginning with the <i>premises</i>
      themselves. A thousand errors arise through the assumption of premises for
      one arising in the misplacement of terms. The Logic of the Schools is an
      elaborate attack upon the lesser evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James Mackintosh has remarked that 'Popular reason can alone correct
      popular sophistry'&mdash;and it is in vain that we expect amendment in the
      reasoning of the multitude, unless we make reasoning intelligible to the
      multitude. As to my object, could I, like Gridiron-Cobbett, adopt a symbol
      of it, I would have engraved Æsop's 'Old Man and his Ass,' who, in a vain
      attempt to please everybody, failed (like his disciples&mdash;for even <i>he</i>
      has disciples) to please anybody. The folly of that superfluously
      philanthropic old gentleman should teach us <i>proportion</i> of purpose.
      To be of real service; to <i>some</i> is in the compass of individual
      capacity, and consequently, the true way of serving, if not of pleasing <i>all</i>.
      The republic of literature, like society, has its aristocratic, its
      middle, and its lower classes. No one has combined, in one performance,
      the refinement applauded in the universities, with the practical purpose,
      popular among those who toil to live, and live to toil. The populace are
      my choice&mdash;of them I am one, and, like a recent premier, Earl Grey,
      am disposed 'to stand by my order.' I write for this class both from
      affection and taste. If I can benefit any, I can them. I know their
      difficulties, for I have encountered them&mdash;their wants, for they have
      been mine. This will account for the liberties taken with the subjects
      upon which I treat. There is more than one kind of hunger that will break
      through barriers, and I have taken with an unlicensed hand, wherever it
      was to be found, what I wanted for myself, and what I know to be wanted by
      those who stand at the anvil and the loom, and who never had the benefits
      of scholastic education, and who never will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the arts and sciences, which formerly resided exclusively in the
      colleges, and ministered only to the sons of opulence and leisure, have
      escaped from their retreat, and have become the hand-maids of the
      populace. But as respects logic, there still remains between the learned
      and the illiterate an impassable gulf. The uninformed look on the
      recondite structure of logic, and they are repelled by the difficulty of
      comprehending it, and wrap themselves up in absolute and obstinate
      ignorance, which they believe to be their destiny. The populace, in our
      manufactories, have to choose between subsistence and intelligence. For
      study, after protracted toil, they have not the strength&mdash;and to
      abridge their labour is to abridge their subsistence, and this they cannot
      afford. But because they are precluded by the destiny of civilisation from
      knowing much, they need not remain utterly unskilled in reasoning. Their
      natural good sense may be systematized, their natural logic may be reduced
      to some rule and order&mdash;though it may not be refined it may be
      practical, it may give power, and develop capacity now dormant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hints, general rules, and elementary remarks dispersed throughout this
      work, will probably be of service to the uninitiated, perhaps put them on
      the road to higher acquirements, give them a confidence in their own
      powers, perhaps inspire them with a love of these essential studies, and
      impart a taste for the refinements which lie beyond. My hope is that many
      will be induced to consult scholastic treatises, and acquire that accurate
      knowledge which makes the society of educated people so interesting.
      Impulse has been given to knowledge, and the populace have begun to think,
      and both to speak and write their thinkings&mdash;and why should they not
      be enabled to do it free from obvious mistakes, and with a broad propriety
      commensurate with the native capacity they possess? Why should they, like
      a certain learned politician on a public occasion, propose, as a
      sentiment, 'The three R's, Reading, 'Riting, and 'Rithmetic?'* Why, in
      writing, should they not express themselves with strong grammatical
      coherence, and a certain bold perspicuity, if not able to reach refinement
      and elegance? Why, in pronunciation, should they not speak with a certain
      manly openness of vowel sound and a distinct articulation, if not with all
      elocutionary modulation? Why should not their discourse be expressed in
      brief, clear sentences? If their punctuation went no farther than placing
      capital letters at the commencement of sentences and of proper names, and
      periods at the conclusion of sentences, it would render their writings
      more intelligible than are half the communications they now send to the
      press. If they mastered only brevity and abrupt directness, and learned to
      omit tedious prolixity, they would command a hearing in many cases where
      now they are denied one. If in logic they made a shrewd mastery of plain
      facts&mdash;being as sure as they could, when once set on surety,
      eschewing conjecture and pernicious supposition&mdash;if they followed the
      methods of nature and good sense, where the elaborate methods of art are
      hidden from them, who will not admit that they would be more intelligible
      than now, exercise a power they never yet possessed, and extort the
      attention and esteem of the public where now they excite only its pity, or
      contempt, or outrage what just taste it has? The people would be enabled
      to do these things, but that so many who prepare treatises for their
      guidance alarm them by the display of abstruse dissertation above their
      powers, their means, their time, and their wants. That a little learning
      is a dangerous thing is not a maxim alone believed in by the race of
      country squires steeped in port and prejudice, but by schoolmen who cannot
      bring themselves to give a little proportion of sound knowledge, but must
      give all, the reconite as well. The statesman decries the ignorance and
      want of wisdom displayed by embryo politicians who will accept no
      instalment of liberty, but insist on the concession of <i>all</i> their
      claims&mdash;but the scholar does the same thing when he will impart none
      but the completest information to the people.
    </p>

     * This case is cited by S. G. Goodrich, the original Peter
     Parley, in his preface to 'Fireside Education.' Sir William
     Curtis, to whom, probably, Mr. Goodrich refers, gave also
     'the three K's&mdash;King, Church, and Constitution.'

    <p>
      In quoting, I have been a borrower, but not a plagiarist. In no case am I
      conscious of having taken from others without at the same time making the
      fairest acknowledgment in my power.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the references to the highest authorities are sometimes through others,
      it is because the highest authorities have not always been accessible.
      Those who have had ordinary experience estimate highly the value of minute
      integrity in this respect. Fruitless hours are spent in tracing false and
      careless references, and to one whose time is his means, no little injury
      is done when it is thus wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unbounded gratitude is due to those authors, old and new, who, with
      learning and grace, with care and patience, have put the world in
      possession of thoughts which are real additions to its knowledge&mdash;and
      corresponding should be the contempt of those whose high-sounding and
      pretending books seduce readers to wade through them only to find in them
      the millioneth echo of some commonplace idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'Spectator' was pleased to say that I wrote 'Practical Grammar' in the
      spirit of an 'ultra-radical, setting the world to rights.' Yet I have
      always declared, with Butler&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Reforming schemes are none of mine,
     To mend the world's a vast design;
     Like those who toil in little boat
     To drag to them the ship afloat.
</pre>
    <p>
      Utopianism is not my idiosyncracy. But I have confidence in endeavour.
      Continuity of ameliorative effort is the sole enthusiasm that can serve
      the cause of improvement. It is useful to do what seems to be useful,
      whether little or much&mdash;a moderate rule, but one that will take those
      who carry it out, a long way.
    </p>
    <p>
      My illustrations, I need scarcely say, are neutral in politics and
      theology. In the grammar of J. A. D. D'Orsey, published in 'Chambers'
      Educational Course,' there are disputations, Biblicisms, and bits of
      intense theology. Professor John Radford Young, in his treatise on
      Algebra, has introduced a reply to Hume's controverted theory of miracles&mdash;and
      Dr. Whately makes his 'Logic' an avowedly theological auxiliary, showing
      that much passes for good taste in this country which is only an
      irrelevant propitiation of powerful opinion. I have not, however, been
      seduced by this species of example. There are distinct provinces in
      intellect as well as in industry&mdash;and what political economy
      justifies in one case, good sense dictates in the other. No man has a
      right to intrude theology into every question, and agitate points of faith
      when he pretends to instruct the understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is less occasion to speak of the utility of logic, than to show it
      to be easy of acquisition. Mr. Stuart Mill, in confirmation of this view,
      observes: We need not seek far for a solution of the question so often
      agitated, respecting the utility of Logic. If a science of logic exists,
      or is capable of existing, it must be useful. If there be rules to which
      every mind conforms, in every instance in which it judges rightly, there
      seems little necessity for discussing whether a person is more likely to
      observe those rules when he knows the rules, than when he is unacquainted
      with them.* Certainly people are not so much prejudiced against logic on
      account of its supposed uselessness as on account of its supposed
      difficulties. Deserved or not, logic has always had a good reputation.
      Well or ill founded, the popular impression has uniformly been in its
      favour. It has been valued like the diamond&mdash;but considered, like
      that precious stone, of very uncertain access.
    </p>

    <p>
      The high popularity of common sense&mdash;'the exercise of the judgment
      unaided by rule'&mdash;has been interpreted into a virtual rejection of
      logic by the multitude. But it ought not to be overlooked, that the credit
      in which mere common sense is held, is a matter of necessity as well as
      choice. It being the best sense the untutored have, they wisely use it,
      and no wonder that they are inclined to laud what they are constrained to
      employ. Doubtless they always perceived that common sense would be the
      better for being made orderly, as a spirited horse is the fitter for use
      after being 'broken.' Logical sense, among the masses, is secretly
      supposed to be disciplined sense, and to have all the advantage of the
      trained soldier over the raw recruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite true, as Abram Tucker puts it, that 'The science of abstruse
      learning, when completely attained, is like Achilles' spear, that healed
      the wounds it had made before; so this knowledge serves to repair the
      damage itself had occasioned, it casts no additional light upon the paths
      of life.' But few persons sensible of the value of exact knowledge will
      complain of the <i>necessary</i> elaboration to which it sometimes leads.
      Nor will those who have felt the thrill of pleasure which complete
      analysis imparts, regret the patience which put them in possession of a
      secret of science, or made them master of a new field of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common sense is the substratum of all logic. Common sense is the natural
      sense of mankind. It is founded on common observation and experience. It
      is modest and plain and unsophisticated. It sees with everybody's eyes and
      hears with everybody's ears. It has no capricious distinctions, no
      partialities, and no mysteries. It never equivocates and never trifles.
      Its language is always the same, and is always intelligible. It is known
      by its perspicuity of speech and singleness of purpose. The most prudent
      of all the children of fact, it never forsakes nature or reason. Some
      outline laws for its employment, if they can be indicated, must be better
      than its popular aimless and desultory use.

      PREFACE OF 1866.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One has no right to make a literary subject political&mdash;that is, to
      make it partisan; but to give a political motive which concerns all
      equally, for promoting a literary study, is allowable, and does not
      partake of the nature of party politics. One may, like Cobbett, look on
      literature with political eyes, without, like him, making it a vehicle of
      party attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this country, where the political genius of the people lies in
      self-government&mdash;where the public growth of the people and their
      internal liberty depend upon their capacity to manage their own affairs&mdash;the
      art of public speaking has political importance to every aide in politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be able to take a subject well in hand, like a stage-coach driver does
      his horses&mdash;to hold the reins of your arguments firmly&mdash;to
      direct and drive well home the burden of your meaning, is a power which
      every man ought to study to attain, who rises to address a council, or
      stands up on a platform to convince a meeting.

      It is a humiliating reflection that mankind never reasoned so ill as when
      they most professed to cultivate the art of reasoning.&mdash;Life of

      Common sense&mdash;the foundation of logic&mdash;first received (to a
      limited extent) the regularity of an art and the certainty of a science,
      from the master hand of Aristotle. Impartial scholars, familiar with his
      writings on logic, allow them to have not only ingenuity but real merit;
      and his admirers contend that he has been misunderstood by some and abused
      by others. This is highly probable, as we are certain that when his works
      were interpreted by the schools, and his logic proclaimed the great
      text-book of knowledge and the only weapon of truth, 'men's minds, instead
      of studying nature, were in an endless ferment about occult qualities and
      imaginary essences; little was talked of but intention and remission,
      proportion and degree, infinity, formality, quiddity and individuality.'*
      Logic then was jargon, controversy chicane, and truth a shuttlecock, with
      which the disputants respectively played, or the object which they
      mutually disguised. Logic was a labyrinth in which the subtlest lost their
      Way&mdash;a bourne from which the traveller after truth seldom returned.

      A striking illustration of this has been furnished by a candid and
      distinguished writer&mdash;Dr. Reid. 'Of the analytics and of the topics
      of Aristotle, ingenuousness requires me to confess, that though I have
      often purposed to read the whole with care, and to understand <i>what is
      intelligible</i>, yet my courage and patience always failed me before I
      had done. Why should I throw away so much time and painful attention upon
      a thing of so little real use? If I had lived in those ages when the
      knowledge of Aristotle's Organon entitled a man to the highest rank in
      philosophy, ambition might have Induced me to employ upon it some years of
      painful study; and, less, I conceive, would not be sufficient. Such
      reflections as these always got the better of my resolution.'*

      Dr. Whately, who has for many years occupied the throne of Logic and whose
      work maybe taken, from its currency in our colleges and academies, as the
      representative of the logic of the schools, seems to obviate all
      objections to the abstruseness of this subject by a counter charge, to the
      effect that logic is now underrated only because it has been overrated.
      But it is not the complexity found in it, but the laudations bestowed upon
      it which have brought it into neglect. Dr. Whately contends that certain
      writers, 'by representing logic as furnishing the sole instrument for the
      discovery of truth in all subjects, and as teaching the use of the
      intellectual faculties in general, raised expectations which could not be
      realised, and which naturally led to a reaction&mdash;to logic being
      regarded as utterly futile and empty.'** Deeply deploring this kind of
      injury, from which many important arts have suffered, I am neither
      disposed to defend such a course, nor to imitate it. But I demur to the
      truth of this representation with regard to logic. If logic be not the
      'sole instrument for the discovery of truth in all subjects,' it is
      certainly the <i>principal</i> one. Instead of charging scholastic
      logicians with having unduly 'raised,' it would be nearer the truth, in my
      opinion, to say that they have <i>confused</i> 'expectations' by intricate
      machinery and extreme elaborations.

    <p>
      Intricacy and minuteness of detail might be a trifling disqualification
      did they lead to something immediately practical. But Dr. Whately contends
      that logic, in the most extensive sense which the name can, with
      propriety, be made to bear, is that of the science, and also the art of
      reasonings 'Inasmuch as logic institutes an analysis of the process of the
      mind in reasoning, it is strictly a <i>science</i>, while considered in
      reference to the practical rules it furnishes it is an <i>art</i>.'* He
      confines the province of logic, as an art, to 'employing language properly
      for the purpose of reasoning,' and restricts the logician to the use of
      the syllogism as the sole test of argument. Mr. Augustus de Morgan thus
      exhibits the spirit of Whately's restriction:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Logic has nothing to do with the truth of the facts, opinions, or
      presumptions, from which an inference is derived; but simply takes care
      that the inference shall certainly be true if the premises be true.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been, and <i>is</i> to be, objected, that logic, thus confined,
      'leaves untouched the greatest difficulties, and those which are the
      sources of the greatest errors in reasoning.' To this powerful objection
      Dr. Whately thinks it sufficient to reply, that 'no art is to be censured
      for not teaching more than falls within its province, and, indeed, more
      than can be taught by any conceivable art. Such a system of universal
      knowledge as should instruct us in the full meaning or meanings of every
      term, and the truth or falsity, certainty or uncertainty of every
      proposition, thus superseding all other studies, it is most
      unphilosophical to expect, or even to imagine. And to find fault with
      logic for not performing this, is as if one should object to optics for
      not giving sight to the blind&mdash;or complain of a reading glass for
      being of no service to a person who had never learnt to read.'*** This
      would be a most conclusive answer if confident assertion could be accepted
      in lieu of proof. The objection still remains to be removed. We may still
      demand, does it not fall within the legitimate province of logic to
      provide means of encountering the 'greatest difficulties' with which it is
      confessed logic is beset? True, there is no art can teach everything, but
      is that a reason why logic should teach nothing, or next to nothing,
      compared with what seems essentially necessary?

    <p>
      Dr. Whately contends that the 'difficulties' and 'errors' in the objection
      adduced, are in the <i>subject matter</i> about which logic is employed,
      and <i>not</i> in the process of reasoning&mdash;which alone is the
      appropriate province of logic. But it seems to me that Dr. Whately has
      found it impossible to keep within the bounds of the restriction he thus
      endeavours to establish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In treating upon 'apprehension,' he introduces, as indeed he was obliged
      to do, from the department of metaphysics, several speculations on
      'generalisation' and 'abstractions,' and from ontology (the science which
      explains the most general conceptions respecting the phenomena of nature)
      he borrows the leading principles of definition. Because he thus goes so
      far, it is not to be contended that <i>therefore</i> he should have gone
      further; but when he found he must depart from his rule and borrow from
      other branches of knowledge (no matter for what end), why did he not
      depart from it to some purpose, and borrow from natural philosophy such
      rules as would have guarded the logician from the 'chief errors' into
      which he may fall?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Whately informs us, indeed, that logic furnishes certain syllogistic
      forms to which all sound arguments may be reduced, and thus establishes
      universal tests for the detection of fallacy&mdash;but it is to be
      observed that it is only <i>such</i> fallacy as may creep in <i>between</i>
      the premises and the conclusion of an argument. It is to this narrow and
      Aristotelian object that logic is restricted. 'The process of reasoning
      itself is alone the appropriate province of logic. This process will have
      been correctly conducted if it have conformed to the logical rules, which
      preclude the possibility of any error creeping in <i>between</i> the
      principles from which we are arguing, and the conclusions we deduce from
      them.'* We learn from our authority, that as arithmetic does not profess
      to introduce any notice of the <i>things</i>, whether coins, persons, or
      dimensions, respecting which calculations are made; neither does logic
      undertake 'the ascertainment of facts, or the degree of evidence of
      doubtful propositions.' And just as an arithmetical result will be useless
      if the data of the calculation be incorrect, so a logical conclusion is
      liable to be false if the premises are so. Neither does the logic, now
      under consideration, concern itself with the 'discovery of truth,'
      excepting so far as that may be said to be implied by the detection of
      error in a false inference.** Logic thus, confined to the actual process
      of reasoning, however important its functions there, evidently leaves us
      in the dark as to the value of what we reason about. For the information
      thus missing, this logic refers us to knowledge in general&mdash;to
      grammar and composition for the art of expressing, with correctness and
      perspicuity, the terms of propositions&mdash;to natural, moral, political,
      or other philosophy, for the facts which alone can establish the truth of
      the premises reasoned from.

    <p>
      The exclusion from logic of all consideration of the facts on which
      propositions are founded, is thus endeavoured to be justified by the
      Archbishop of Dublin:&mdash;'No arithmetical skill will secure a correct
      result, unless the data are correct from which we calculate: nor does any
      one on that account undervalue arithmetic; and yet the objection against
      logic rests on no better foundation.' This is true, but is it true that
      arithmetic is on <i>this account</i> to be imitated? If the arithmetician
      must take his data for granted, it is what the searcher after truth must
      never do&mdash;<i>he</i> must use his eyes and examine for himself, in all
      cases, as far as possible, unless he intends to be deceived. And for want
      of such precaution as this, the arithmetician is at sea the moment he
      steps out of the narrow path of mechanical routine. Who is not aware of
      the failures of calculation when applied to the general business of life&mdash;to
      statistics, moral and political? Every day, facts have to be called in to
      correct the egregious blunders of figures.* The calculations are conducted
      in most approved form, but are of no use. Does not this demonstrate that
      when arithmetic, like logic, is applied to the business of life, general
      rules for securing the accuracy of data would be of essential service?
      Supposing, however, that arithmetic could do very well without them, does
      it follow that logic should, when it would be safer and more efficient
      with them?

      Since our author's canons are held absolute in the schools, it may be
      useful to consider this last cited argument in another light. A stronger
      objection may be urged, one which particularly addresses itself to those
      who mistake mere pertinence for general relevance, and suppose that a
      single analogy decides a case.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Grace reasons, that, because arithmetic does not concern itself about
      its data, logic should follow the same example. But why overlooks he pure
      mathematics&mdash;a much higher science than arithmetic? Surely geometry,
      which through all time has been the model of the sciences, was better
      worthy than arithmetic to be the model of logic! Was it classical in the
      principal of St. Alban's College to abandon Euclid and cleave unto Cocker
      or Walkingame?
    </p>
    <p>
      Arithmetic is mechanical&mdash;geometry is reasoning; surely it was more
      befitting to compare reason with reason, when endeavouring to discover the
      true way of perfecting reason. Geometry is, of all sciences, reputed the
      most conclusive in its arguments&mdash;and we know it is distinguished
      above all sciences for carefulness in its data. It begins with axioms, the
      most indubitable of all data, and its subsequent conclusions are founded
      only on established facts&mdash;and to be sure that they are established
      facts, the geometer, before he employs them, establishes them himself. If
      an analogy is to decide the province of logic, here is an analogy whose
      pretensions over those of arithmetic are eminent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So conclusive did Dr. Whately deem the argument just examined, that he
      many times, in various forms, reproduced it. One of the last instances is
      under the head of 'Fallacies.' 'It has been made a subject of bitter
      complaint against logic, that it presupposes the most difficult point to
      be already accomplished; viz., the sense of the terms to be ascertained. A
      similar objection might be urged against every other art in existence
      e.g., against agriculture, that all the precepts for the cultivation of
      land presuppose the possession of a farm.'*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Logic, chap. 3.  Fallacies, sec. 2.
</pre>
    <p>
      Already has been pointed out what may reasonably induce a suspicion of the
      soundness of these analogies; viz., that their author found it necessary
      to disregard them and introduce, from other branches of knowledge, certain
      disquisitions on the 'sense of terms.' With regard to this particular
      instance, it may be observed, that though treatises on agriculture do
      presuppose the possession of a farm, they do not presuppose the knowledge
      requisite for cultivating it, but inform <i>fully</i> of soil, and seed,
      and crops. So logic may be allowed to presuppose the existence of the
      universe, whence truth is drawn, or the existence of language, 'whereby it
      is expressed; but it is surely not to <i>pre-suppose</i> the knowledge of
      facts and terms, the great instruments for the cultivation of truth.
      Agricultural treatises hardly warrant this inference. There are the
      representations that induced the confession that 'Logic is not so much an
      instrument of acquirement as of defence. It is a good armour to buckle on
      when compelled to battle for our heritage, but a poor implement for its
      cultivation.'*
    </p>
    <p>
      All <i>practical</i> arts include a knowledge of materials as well as
      implements. Platers, ignorant of the nature of metals, cabinetmakers, of
      the different species of wood, make but sorry artizans; and in like
      manner, reasoners, unacquainted, at least in a general way, with the
      accuracy of what is reasoned about, make but sorry logicians.**
    </p>
    <p>
      It will readily be expected that in the modern progress of knowledge, the
      Aristotelian province of logic would be enlarged. The far-seeing intellect
      of Lord Verulam heralded the innovation&mdash;'Our glorious Bacon led
      philosophy forth from the jargon of schools and the fopperies of sects. He
      made her to be&mdash;the handmaid of nature, friendly to her creatures,
      and faithful to her laws.'***

      The general object of Lord Bacon's philosophy, writes Bruce, an Edinburgh
      professor of logic of the last century, is to connect the reasoning powers
      of man with experiments for the improvement of natural knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a just taste for philosophical investigation, required&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. A display of the true, that they may be distinguished from the false
      subjects of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Scientific rules to direct the discovery of the laws of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to 'display the true,' is to display the <i>facts</i> on which the
      truth rests. The 'discovery of the laws of nature' implies <i>observation</i>
      of the operations of nature. The philosophy of Bacon, says Macaulay, began
      in observation and ended in arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is most obvious, as the reader will gather from what has been advanced,
      that for guarding, to the greatest possible extent, against error in
      conclusions, it is necessary to take into consideration the character of
      the data from which we reason&mdash;and to do this, we must draw from the
      general sources of knowledge to which the Logic of the Schools refers us.
      If we happen not to possess an accurate acquaintance with these branches,
      we must draw upon the best notions we have of them, or apply such natural
      sagacity as we happen to possess. But whether the information we happen to
      possess be complete or partial, it is not well that we are left to apply
      it at random, without any definite mode of procedure; and if logic refuses
      to assist us, and gives only a vague reference elsewhere, we must
      endeavour to assist ourselves. The datum of all arguments is a
      proposition, an assertion, or denial; and to ascertain its truth (upon
      which the value of the whole reasoning depends) we have to do with the
      facts upon which it rests, and the terms in which it is expressed. For it
      may be here observed, that the truth or falsity of every proposition
      depends upon facts. To ascertain the general accuracy of facts, we have to
      appeal to received standards of certainty; and to fix the meaning of
      terms, we have recourse to a plain principle of definition. In the task of
      recognising truth, so necessary in examining the premises of an argument,
      one is wonderfully assisted by being familiarised with the sources of
      truth, and the mode of its discovery. In these operations the tutored and
      untutored may alike be assisted by simple general rules. If these rules
      prove not infallible in every case, they will prove successful in the
      majority of cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since general rules are the only, rules that the vast field of facts
      admits of, they are not to be rejected on light grounds. They enable us to
      set forth intelligibly the reasons of our own conviction, and to detect
      and expose the fundamental fallacies of apparent arguments. Since they
      direct us where the Logic of the Schools leaves us without a guide, their
      value is apparent.

      The logical management of the syllogism involves much abstruseness
      respecting 'genus' and 'species,' the 'quantity' and 'quality' of
      'propositions', 'contraries,' 'sub-contraries,' 'contradictions,' and
      'subalterns.' Stepping by 'illative conversion,' 'six rules to be observed
      with respect to categorical syllogism' next demand attention, followed
      hard by eleven moods which can be used in a legitimate syllogism, Viz.&mdash;&mdash;

      This is certainly not the portal through which the populace can at present
      pass to logic, even if such logic helped them to all truth, and saved them
      from all fallacy.

      But this species of logic is not without interest. Symbolic letters and
      mnemonic lines are not without attractions to those who understand them.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Heavy bodies naturally tend to the centre of the universe.
  We know, by experience, that heavy bodies tend to the centre of the earth.

      But by what experience did Aristotle discover the centre of the universe,
      so as to become aware that heavy bodies <i>naturally</i> tend there? On
      what facts rest the measurement of the radii from our earth to the
      boundless circumference of space? How did he ascertain the limits of that
      which has no limits? Yet, strange to say, the Logic of the Schools prides
      itself in leaving us where the Stagyrite left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When mankind began to reason on the phenomena of nature, they were
      solicitous to <i>abstract</i>, and they formed general propositions from a
      <i>limited</i> observation. Though these propositions were assumed, they
      were admitted as true. They were not examined <i>by appeals to nature</i>,

      In this syllogism from Aristotle, there is the usual compliance with

      to encourage the belief that we can have reason and argument, without the
      truth? Only this shallow consolation remains to us. If the logician of the

      Syllogisms are to truth what rhyme is to poetry. 'It is a well known fact

      According to the Logic of the Schools, 'the question respecting the
      validity of an argument is not whether the conclusion be <i>true</i>, but
      whether it <i>follows</i> from the premises adduced.' It was the bitter
      experience of Bordon of the delusiveness of such partial logic that
      induced him to exclaim, '<i>one</i> fact is worth fifty <i>arguments</i>.'

    <p>
      With such authorities, 'a valid argument is that which it so stated that
      its conclusiveness is evident from the mere <i>form</i> of the
      expression.' But since it is admitted that if the data reasoned upon be
      incorrect, no logical skill can secure a correct result; it is evident
      that however <i>faultless the form</i>, the inquirer after truth is in no
      way nearer his object, unless he be instructed how to lay a foundation of
      <i>faultless facts</i>. He then, who is in love with truth rather than
      logomachy, will admit, in spite of the most ingenious analogies, that
      there is some room for a logic of facts, as well as a logic of words.

      CHAPTER II. LOCKE-LOGIC.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Logic is a general guide to the discovery of truth, and teaches us its
      systematic communication to others. This definition is intended to combine
      logic and rhetoric into one system. According to a quotation in Pinnock's
      Guide to Knowledge, Locke defined logic as 'that art by which we rightly
      use our mental faculties in the discovery and communication of truth,' a
      definition, called by the writer, the definition of nature echoed by
      genius. There exists a natural connection between logic and rhetoric. The
      discovery of truth could avail us little if we were without the means of
      communicating it; and it is easy to see that it would be in vain to
      possess the means of communicating truth, unless we had the truth to
      communicate. Therefore, ingenuity is but ill employed in separating these
      mutual departments of learning which nature has connected together.
      Besides, the skill of the logician is as serviceable in the statement of a
      case, as in arguing it. Arrangement is as much a matter of logic as
      ratiocination; and to impress this neglected truth upon the young
      inquirer, is one reason for proposing a combined definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mutual connection of logic and rhetoric is illustrated by the fact,
      that the Logic of the Schools is purely a branch of rhetoric. It consists
      in putting an argument into 'the most perspicuous form in which it can be
      exhibited,'*&mdash;i. e., in <i>communicating</i> it in the most efficient
      way to others.

    <p>
      Indeed, Dr. Whately (who makes logic to consist in reasoning) defines
      reasoning as <i>discourse</i>, and discourse is rhetoric. '<i>Grammar</i>,'
      says Doherty,' represents the mechanism of letters in forming words&mdash;<i>Rhemar</i>,
      the mechanism of words in forming sentences. We have <i>Grammar</i> for
      letters, <i>Rhemar</i> for words, <i>Logic for arguments</i>, and <i>Rhetoric</i>
      for discourse.' Locke-logic, therefore&mdash;i. e., logic in the sense in
      which Locke treated it&mdash;seems to come nearer the truth, as well as
      nearer the common requirement, than the restricted definition of it by
      others insisted on.

      CHAPTER III. LOGICAL TRUTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      All men know something of truth. Happily it is the first impulse of
      childhood, and nature teaches us its pleasure before reason instructs us
      in its truth. In infancy we own its beauty, in manhood its power. There is
      nothing, says Cicero, sweeter to man than the light of truth. Truth,
      observes Godwin, is the native element of an intellectual nature. It has
      been wisely remarked, said Lord Kames, that truth is to the understanding
      what beauty is to the eye, or music to the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philosophy sanctions what unsophisticated feelings suggested. He that has
      made but a little progress beyond ignorance and privilege, cannot be
      edified by anything but truth.** Truth, like a mathematical point, has had
      various descriptions; and it may be useful to select those which graduate
      to its logical definition. Bulwer tells us, that 'the agitation of thought
      is the beginning of truth.' Locke, Lord Kames, Mill, and others, agree
      that truth, or falsehood, is an affair of language. An assertion which
      represents things as they really are, is a truth&mdash;an assertion that
      represents things what in reality they are <i>not</i>, is a falsehood.

      Truth, in sculpture, means an exact similitude of some living form,
      chiselled in stone or marble. Truth, in painting, is a natural
      representation on canvass of some person, or object. In the same manner,
      moral 'truth is an exact image of things set forth in speech, or writing.'
      The logical definition of truth is given in these words:&mdash;'Truth is
      that which admits of proof,'* that is, an assertion or denial which can be
      substantiated by facts.

    <p>
      A fact is commonly called a truth, but this practice leads to great
      confusion in reasoning. A fact is only an element in truth, A logical
      truth is a proposition supported by facts. Facts compose the premises of
      an argument&mdash;a truth is the inference from the facts. Unless this
      distinction is observed, recourse must be had to the expedient of calling
      a fact a particular truth, and an induction from facts a general truth. Or
      we must adopt this distinction, that a moral truth, that is, the truth of
      parlance, is the coincidence of language with reality; and a logical
      truth, a proposition which admits of demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady, who has given intellectual laws to many whom I address, has said&mdash;'A
      truth I consider to be an ascertained fact, which truth would be changed
      into an error the moment the fact on which it rested was disproved.' But
      that which can be disproved cannot be an '<i>ascertained</i> fact.'
      Allowing, however, the relevancy of this definition of a truth, it would,
      in a treatise on logic, be considered as a definition only of a particular
      truth. Many such truths are required to make a logical truth.

</pre>
    <p>
      Observation** of nature is the only source of truth. Discursive
      observation is the art of noticing circumstances evident to the senses.
      Men who do this intentionally and carefully, with a view of acquiring a
      knowledge of phenomena and their causes, are distinguished for their
      varied knowledge and often for their great discoveries. Shakspere must
      have owed the varied facts interwoven into his delineations of human
      character to this source. The clever personations of Garrick were
      suggested by his curious observations of men and manners. Sir Walter Scott
      is known to have been a careful observer. It is said, 'no expression
      escaped him if it bore on the illustration of character.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     ** The term observation is used here in the sense in which
     it is commonly understood, signifying cognisance in general.

      Claude Lorraine, with a passionate sympathy for the beautiful, sate in the
      fields from sun-rise to dewy eve, watching, catching, and saturating his
      very soul, as it were, with all the evanescent beauties of a summer's day,
      as they chased each other over the face of the fair scene; fixing on
      canvass, taking captive and imprisoning in our cabinets, the wanton
      daughters of nature, that before his time never were caught, but flitted
      before the fascinated eye only long enough to make the heart afterwards
      feel more achingly the void of their vanishing. And the artist who has
      done all this, do we not justly call him an <i>imaginative</i> painter, to
      distinguish him from those meaner geniuses who were, in painting, very
      like Crabbe in poetry, merely faithful delineators of the vulgarer objects
      of social life, bunches of carrots, drunken boors, chamber maids and
      chimney corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has the reader ever seen Mr. Macready in the character of Macbeth? If he
      have, he can never forget the stupefied murderer withdrawing from the
      chamber in which he has just done the dread act, with fascinated gaze
      retreatingly regarding his royal victim, and awaking with a guilty start
      as he runs unconsciously against his hard-souled partner in guilt, who in
      vain tries to infuse into the weaker spirit of her paralysed husband her
      own metaphysical superiority. In this scene we know that Mr. Macready's
      acting was perfect, for the pressure at our heart, the suspension of our
      breathing, and the creeping of our hair, made us <i>feel</i> that it was
      so. We see him now, as stealthily he places his foot over the threshold of
      the chamber of death to re-appear on the stage; the intensely staring eye,
      that cannot remove from what 'tis horror to look upon; the awfully natural
      absorption of his soul by that "sorry sight," which one little minute has
      brought about; his starting and awaking from his entranced state, as he
      runs against his wife in his retreat, and his full passionate burst of
      blended remorse, terror, and superstition, as refusing counsel, regardless
      of remonstrance, heedless of probable detection, he pours forth his
      "brain-sickly" convictions, of having in one little moment cut the cable
      that had held him to the rest of the great human family. All this we can
      see in our mind's eye, for the actor gave us a picture of passion that
      time can never obliterate. But how would it have been with a cloddish
      unimaginative fellow, whom nature never intended should understand
      Shakspere? Would he not, conscious that he was among shoals and quicksands
      of feelings, too nice for his appreciation, seek to tear over all by a
      tempest of rant, which would be a more ruthless murder on Shakspere than
      Macbeth's on the king? And why should we be delighted with Mr. Macready's
      delineation, and disgusted with the ranter? Simply because the former has
      <i>observed</i>, treasured up, and felt every genuine exhibition of human
      feeling that came in his way, and applied it appropriately to all the
      situations to which it was related in nature. A single instance will make
      this clear. Mr. Kean one night, in the concluding part of the combat scene
      of Richard III., when supposed to be wounded to the death, before falling,
      steadily regarded his foe, and painfully raising his right arm in act to
      strike, the relaxed and dying limb, unable to second the spirit, fell
      heavily and harmlessly to his side, indicating merely the fierce bravery
      of the usurper living in all its strength, when the body which it would
      move, was all but a senseless clod. Pit, gallery, and boxes arose with an
      enthusiasm beyond description, and by their repeated plaudits bore
      testimony the intense naturalness of the struggle. The actor being
      afterwards complimented upon the <i>hit</i>, said, that he had taken the
      action from Jack Painter, the prize-fighter, when the latter was beaten in
      some one of his contests, and it immediately struck the tragedian that the
      very same thing would come in beautifully in the dying scene of Richard
      III. What was this, if not imagination? Kean saw Painter's action to be
      the natural effects of undying valour in vain endeavouring to contend
      against overwhelming power. Remembering and associating it with his
      previous conception of the character of Richard III., the actor saw it
      could be most strikingly incorporated with that picture of passion the
      usurper's death should present to our view. Seeing this, he combined it
      with his previous delineation, and thereby did precisely the same thing as
      the poet in using a fine simile, or the painter in introducing sun-light
      over a part of his picture. It was a portion of nature carried away by the
      actor to be reproduced on a future and fitting occasion.'*

      The beginning of all knowledge is observation. It has been shown by Mr.
      Mill that 'axioms,' which lie at the foundation of all reasoning and all
      science, 'are experimental truths&mdash;generalisations <i>from
      observation</i>. The proposition that Two straight lines cannot inclose a
      space&mdash;or, in other words, Two straight lines which have once met do
      not meet again, but continue to diverge&mdash;is an induction from the <i>evidence
      of our senses.</i>'** 'Axioms are but a class of inductions from <i>experience</i>:
      the simplest and easiest cases of generalisation,' from the facts
      furnished to, us by our senses or by our internal consciousness.'***

      We have lately been told that 'Poetry is called upon to work in the <i>discovery</i>
      of truth. The imagination has always been the great discovering power.
      Discoveries are the poetry of science. The case is rare indeed in which,
      by merely advancing step by step in the exercise of the logical faculty,
      any new truth has been arrived at. Logic comes afterwards, to verify that
      which imagination sees with its far-darting glance.'****

      This seems to call upon us to recognise the imagination as fresh source of
      truth. But the definition of imagination, as given by Emerson, reveals to
      us its origin in observation;&mdash;'The imagination may be defined to be
      the use which reason makes of the material world. Shakspere's imperial
      muse tosses the creation like a bauble from hand to hand, to embody any
      capricious shade of thought that is uppermost in his mind.' Hence, though
      we agree with Gilfillan that imagination is thought on fire, we must
      confess that the ignition is material.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will, however, hear a poet's defence of his fraternity:&mdash;'Poets
      are vulgarly considered deficient in the reasoning faculty; whereas no man
      was ever a great poet without having it in excess, and after a century or
      two, men become convinced of it. They jump the middle terms of their
      syllogisms, it is true, and assume premises to which the world has not yet
      arrived; but time stamps their deductions as invincible.'*
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagination is based on observation, and bears the same relation to the
      'material world' that the magician bears to the appliances of his art.
      Imagination is the dexterous and astonishing use of realities. It is a
      species of mental experiment, whereby, without permission of the
      line-and-rule men, we join strange things together, and to the surprise of
      every body, the junction is a happy one. 'Angelo's greatness lay in
      searching for untried existence.'** But observation primarily suggests the
      combination. If, as in the case of Angelo, imagination essays the highest
      flights of genius, and goes in search of untried existence, it is not
      existence out of nature, but founded upon nature&mdash;its success is a
      revelation of some hidden reality.

      Some of the most praised conceptions of Shakspere have been traced by
      critics to the tritest observation. Instance Hamlet's remark:&mdash;

     There's a divinity doth shape our ends,
     Bough-hew them as we will.

      Critics tell us, that Shakspere here fell into the conventional cant of a
      mechanic making skewers. But it is no detraction to cull the best phrases
      from the most common sources. Knight remarks:&mdash;'Philosophy, as
      profound as it is beautiful! says the uninitiated reader of Shakspere. But
      he that is endued with the wisdom of the commentators, will learn how easy
      it is to mistake for philosophy and poetry what really only proceeded from
      the very vulgar recollection of an ignorant mind. Dr. Farmer informs me,
      says Steevens, that these words are merely technical. A woodman, butcher,
      and dealer in skewers, lately observed to him, that his nephew (an idle
      lad), could only assist in making them; he could rough-hew them, but I was
      obliged to shape their ends. To shape the ends of wood skewers, i. e., to
      point them, requires a degree of skill: any one can rough-hew them.
      Whoever recollects the profession of Shakspere's father, will admit that
      his son might be no stranger to such terms. I have frequently seen
      packages of wool pinned up with skewers.'* To admit the likelihood of all
      this, notwithstanding Mr. Knight's jeer at the 'wisdom of the
      commentators,' is rather to exalt than degrade the genius of Shakspere,
      who could derive exalted figures from humble sources. The 'Athenæum,' far
      more wisely than Mr. Knight, in this instance, observes:&mdash;'This is
      the test of a truly great man; that his thoughts should be <i>things</i>,
      and become things in instantaneous act, and not for a moment mere
      speculations and abstractions.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As the theories of the schoolmen subside, and men no longer ignore nature,
      it will become recognised as the source rather than the tool of intellect.
      We shall have less occasion to contend that all lofty and sublime ideas
      derive their value and beauty from their coherence with the instincts of
      sensation, 'Poetry, we grant, creates a world of its own; but it creates
      it out of <i>existing</i> materials.' 'Imagination' may be but 'thought on
      fire,' but the spark, which ignites it, is material. Is there any other
      distinction between the nights of the rhapsodist and those of genius, than
      that genius <i>illumines</i> reality and rhapsody <i>obscures</i> it? 'We
      know of no great generalisation that has ever been made by a man
      unacquainted with the details on which it rests.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Experiment is invented observation. It is putting into operation certain
      supposed causes in order to observe their effects. An experiment may be
      defined as an observation, which we are at some trouble to make.
      Experiment is usually set down as being a process of discovering truth
      different from observation. It is evidently included under observation,
      and there is no practical advantage in separating it. Discursive, general,
      ordinary, or common observation is the observation of the phenomena we <i>find</i>.
      Experiment is observation of the phenomena we <i>bring together</i>.
      Experimental observation has been the great agent of modern discovery.
      Newton ranked it as the most valuable knowledge. Whatever is not founded
      on phenomena is hypothesis, and has no place in experimental philosophy.
      It is the principal source of accurate facts. When Jenner first
      communicated to John Hunter, what he thought respecting the prevention of
      small pox&mdash;'Don't think, but try; be patient, be accurate,' was
      Hunter's characteristic reply. Locke remarks&mdash;'While the philosophy
      of Aristotle prevailed in the schools, which dealt often in words without
      meaning, the knowledge of nature was at a stand; men argued concerning
      things of which they had no idea; in this enlightened age, we keep to
      trial and experiment, as the only certain foundation of philosophy.'

      Hypothesis may be noticed here as being a species of <i>embryo</i>
      experiment. Hypothesis is guessing at the truth. It is a conjecture or
      supposition relating to the cause of an effect. It imagines that where
      certain conditions exist, the desired result will ensue. But all these
      conjectures must be founded on observation. For, in the wildest
      conjecture, unless made by a madman, there is some reason. Hypothesis is
      incipient truth founded on a few facts which make it probable, but not on
      sufficient to make it certain. Hypothesis does not directly discover
      truth, but it is a guide to experiment, which does. The hypotheses of
      Columbus respecting an unknown continent, did not of itself discover
      America&mdash;but it directed the experiment of his voyage there, which
      did. To hypothesise alone is the error of the visionary and the dreamer.
      Practical wisdom, as far as possible, tests hypothesis by experiment. Sir
      C. Bell conjectured that the nervous fluid of the human body was analogous
      to galvanic fluid, and then, by experiments on various animals, he
      endeavoured to test his hypothesis. However, great thinkers arise who are
      best employed in contriving plans for others to execute&mdash;in telling
      others what they are to do. Great poets belong to this class. They are
      often incapable of the concentrated labour of furnishing proofs of their
      hypothesis. Gladly should we recognise the mission of such men. They work
      for humanity by thinking for humanity. 'All who think,' says Lytton, 'are
      co-operative with all who work.' Labour supplies our wants, thought
      teaches us dominion over nature. Labour is but the means of subsistence,
      it is thought that makes it the source of wealth by multiplying its
      powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the value of hypothesis Mr. Mill bears this testimony, that by
      suggesting observations and experiments, it puts us upon the road to,
      independent evidence, if it be really attainable, and till it be attained,
      the hypothesis ought not to count for more than a suspicion. The function
      of hypothesis is one which must be reckoned absolutely indispensable in
      science. Without such assumption, science would not have attained its
      present state. Nearly everything which is now theory was once hypothesis.*

      Induction is systematic observation of a given class of phenomena. It
      consists in bringing together a variety of facts and instances, carefully
      and patiently viewing them in all possible lights to discover from a
      comparison of the whole what, if any, new principle is elicitable.
      Induction is an experiment with a number of facts, to see if any general
      result can be arrived at. Thus observation is of three kinds&mdash;discursive,
      experimental, and inductive. For brevity of speech, we use respectively
      the terms observation, experiment, and induction, as the names of the
      three recognised modes of investigation. But it facilitates a clear view
      of this subject, to note that experiment and induction are but phases of
      observation&mdash;and that observation is the great source of the
      discovery of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discursive observation and experiment are the sources of facts or
      particular truths. Nature, poetically says Dr. Reid, is put to the
      question by a thousand observations and experiments, and forced to confess
      her secrets. Out of these secrets induction gathers its general truths,
      which become the premises of argument. Facts, like stones, are of little
      service while scattered&mdash;it is in the edifice raised by them that
      their value is apparent. They have been compared to blocks, upon <i>one</i>
      of which, if a person stand, he has but a partially increased view; but
      when many are piled up, a person from their summit commands the prospect
      round. Particular truth seldom proves anything but itself. Argument is
      proving something else, and we have seen that that which is proved must be
      <i>contained</i> in something which proves it. In other words, an argument
      is an assertion or denial of something substantiated by other things&mdash;by
      facts.

      Gall <i>observed</i> the peculiar formation of a certain head, but the one
      fact proved nothing, except that the head had a certain form. It was a
      barren observation, except that it suggested to his imagination the
      hypothesis that the peculiar form of the head might be caused by
      peculiarity of mind. This set him upon the experiment of observing the
      habits and dispositions of the individual in order to test his hypothesis.
      But the one fact of finding a peculiarity proved nothing new of any value.
      The two facts, though incident, were hardly convincing. They proved only
      that a peculiar head was accompanied in one case by peculiar habits&mdash;but
      whether one was the cause of the other, or whether the phenomena were in
      any way connected, still remained unknown. When, however, Gall, Spurzheim,
      and others, had travelled through Europe, making observations and
      experiments, and at last putting all the facts and instances together, and
      carefully and patiently viewing them in all possible lights, and finding
      that they shadowed forth that the brain was the organ, the map and measure
      of intelligence, they inducted a general truth, which enters the lists of
      argument and takes its place as an addition to our metaphysical and moral
      treasures.

      Mr. Macaulay, who, perhaps, might be accused of underrating both Bacon and
      Induction, with a view of exalting Aristotle, remarks that 'The vulgar
      notion about Bacon we take to be this, that he invented a new method of
      arriving at truth, which method is called induction, and that he detected
      some fallacy in the syllogistic reasoning which had been in vogue before
      his time. This notion is about as well founded as that of the people who,
      in the middle ages, imagined that Virgil was a great conjurer. Many who
      are far too well informed to talk such extravagant nonsense, entertain
      what we think incorrect notions as to what Bacon really effected in this
      matter. The inductive method has been practised ever since the beginning
      of the world by every human being. It is constantly practised by the most
      ignorant clown, by the most thoughtless schoolboy, by the very child at
      the breast. That method leads the clown to the conclusion, that if he sows
      barley he shall not reap wheat. By that method, the schoolboy learns that
      a cloudy day is the best for catching trout. The very infant we imagine is
      led by induction to expect milk from his mother or nurse, and none from
      his father. Not only is it not true that Bacon invented the inductive
      method, but it is not true that he was the first person who correctly
      analysed that method and explained its uses. Aristotle had long before
      pointed out the absurdity of supposing that syllogistic reasoning could
      ever conduct men to the discovery of any new principle, had shown that
      such discoveries must be made by induction and by induction alone, and had
      given the history of the inductive process concisely, indeed, but with
      great perspicuity and precision. We are not inclined to ascribe much
      practical value to that analysis of the Inductive method which Bacon has
      given in the second book of the Novum Organon. It is, indeed, an elaborate
      and correct analysis. But it is an analysis of that which we are all doing
      from morning to night, and which we continue to do even in our dream.'*

    <p>
      It is not 'some fallacy in the syllogistic reasoning' which Bacon is
      supposed to have detected, it is rather the partial protection against
      error afforded by syllogisms, which he exposed and provided against, for
      which he is estimated. Certainly Aristotle must have had a very different
      opinion of the value of inductive philosophy from that entertained by
      Bacon, or he would have indoctrinated his disciples with it. Few will
      doubt that had Bacon's Novum Organon appeared in the place of Aristotle's
      logic, and Aristotle's work in the place of Bacon's, that the advancement
      of learning in the world would now be in a very different state. Could
      Bacon have arrested the attention of the ancient sages with his methods of
      discovering new principles, ancient philosophy, instead of being a
      treadmill, would have been a path, and we should not have had a contempt
      for all learning which was useful. When Posidonius said that we owed to
      philosophy the principles of the arch and the introduction of metals. We
      should not have had Seneca repudiating such insulting compliments, nor
      Archimedes considering that geometry was degraded by being employed in
      anything useful.

      But these observations of Macaulay have the merit of showing us that
      induction has its foundation in nature, and afford a further confirmation
      of our views, that observation is the source of our knowledge, and that it
      is the province of logic to teach us to systematise our thoughts.
      Observation, experiment, hypothesis and induction, are but different names
      for the operation&mdash;varying in degree, in method, in expedient, and
      elaboration&mdash;whereby we discover truth. Nature is the treasure-house
      of truth, and the sole fee of appropriation is attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much discussion has taken place upon the nature of necessary truths. Mr.
      Mill, however, after an elaborate analysis of Dr. Whewell's theory,
      pronounces that 'nothing is necessary except the connection between a
      conclusion and the premises.' A necessary truth is commonly defined as a
      proposition, the negation of which is not only false, but inconceivable.
      Mr. Mill contests this doctrine in words embodying suggestions of great
      value.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now I cannot but wonder that so much stress should be laid upon the
      circumstance of inconceivableness, when there is such ample experience to
      show that our capacity or incapacity of conceiving a thing has very little
      to do with a possibility of the thing in itself; but is in truth very much
      an affair of accident, and depends upon the past history and habits of our
      own minds. There is no more generally acknowledged fact in human nature,
      than the extreme difficulty at first felt in conceiving anything as
      possible, which is in contradiction to long established and familiar
      experience; or even to old and familiar habits of thought. And this
      difficulty is a necessary result of the fundamental laws of the human
      mind. When we have often seen and thought of two things together, and have
      never in any one instance either seen or thought of them separately, there
      is by the primary law of association an increasing difficulty, which in
      the end becomes insuperable, of conceiving the two things apart. This is
      most of all conspicuous in uneducated persons, who are in general utterly
      unable to separate any two ideas which have once become firmly associated
      in their minds; and if persons of cultivated intellect have any advantage
      on the point, it is only because, having seen and heard and read more, and
      been more accustomed to exercise their imagination, they have experienced
      their sensations and thoughts in more varied combinations, and have been
      prevented from forming these inseparable associations. But this advantage
      has necessarily its limits. The man of the most practised intellect is not
      exempt from the universal laws of our conceptive faculty. If daily habit
      presents to him for a long period two facts in combination, and if he is
      not led during that period either by accident or intention to think of
      them apart, he will in time become incapable of doing so even by the
      strongest effort; and the supposition that the two facts can be separated
      in nature, will at last present itself to his mind with all the characters
      of an inconceivable phenomenon. There are remarkable instances of this in
      the history of science: instances, in which the wisest men rejected as
      impossible, because inconceivable, things which their posterity, by
      earlier practice and longer perseverance in the attempt, found it quite
      easy to conceive, and which everybody knows to be true. 'If, then, it be
      so natural to the human mind, even in its highest state of culture, to be
      incapable of conceiving, and on that ground to believe impossible, what is
      afterwards not only found to be conceivable but proved to be true; what
      wonder if in cases where the association is still older, more confirmed,
      and more familiar, and in which nothing ever occurs to shake our
      conviction, or even suggest to us any conception at variance with the
      association, the acquired incapacity should continue, and be mistaken for
      a natural incapacity? It is true our experience of the varieties in nature
      enables us, within certain limits, to conceive other varieties analogous
      to them. We can conceive the sun or moon falling; for although we never
      saw them fall, nor ever perhaps, imagined them falling, we have seen so
      many other things fall, that we have innumerable familiar analogies to
      assist the conception; which after all, we should probably have some
      difficulty in framing, were we not well accustomed to see the sun and moon
      move, (or appear to move,) so that we are only called upon to conceive a
      slight change in the direction of motion, a circumstance familiar to our
      experience. But when experience affords no model on which to shape the new
      conception, how is it possible for us to form it? How, for example, can we
      imagine an end to space or time? We never saw any object without something
      beyond it, nor experienced any feeling without something following it.
      When, therefore, we attempt to conceive the last point of space, we have
      the idea irresistibly raised of other points beyond it. When we try to
      imagine the last instant of time, we cannot help conceiving another
      instant after it Nor is there any necessity to assume, as is done by a
      modern school of metaphysicians, a peculiar fundamental law of the mind to
      account for the feeling of infinity inherent in our conceptions of space
      and time; that apparent infinity is sufficiently accounted for by simpler
      and universally acknowledged laws.'*

      Thus we stand on the verge of boundless possibility. What truths may yet
      be discovered in that great and untrodden field, which lies without our
      experience, no man can tell. All we have yet brought between assertion and
      proof, is all we have yet conquered, is all that we as yet know, is all
      that we can yet rely upon. The search after the untried is the highest and
      apparently the inherent aspiration of roan. The revelation of new worlds
      continually rewards his noble ambition. At once arrested and allured by
      the magnificence of nature&mdash;we wonder, we work, we wait.

      CHAPTER V. FACTS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     We must never forget that accurate and multiplied
     quantitative facts form the only substantial basis of
     science.&mdash;Parker.
</pre>
    <p>
      As clear fountains send forth pellucid streams, so do clear truths give
      accurate sciences. The more definite the facts, the more perfect the
      science; it is therefore of importance that all facts should be capable of
      being tested by the standard of physical certainty. Dr. Reid says, that
      'the inquirer after truth must take only facts for his guide.' It is then
      of moment that he takes true and not false guides. A writer in the
      'Monthly Repository' observes, that 'the basis of all knowledge is such an
      extensive induction from particular facts, as leads to general conclusions
      and fundamental axioms'&mdash;and if the facts are erroneous, evidently
      the conclusions will be also erroneous. He also remarks, that 'in
      reasoning, all sciences are the same, being founded on an examination of
      facts&mdash;comparison of ideas.' But If the examination is incomplete, or
      the facts admitted incorrect, the comparison will be alike defective and
      the reasoning vitiated. If suppositions or conjectures are mixed up with
      facts, the inductions from them will be suppositions, and the conclusions
      but conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three words&mdash;consciousness, conscience, and
      conscientiousness&mdash;very much alike to the ear but very different in
      signification. Consciousness, is feeling&mdash;conscience, the sense of
      right and wrong&mdash;-conscientiousness, the practice of what is believed
      to be right. Conscience and conscientiousness are often confounded. We
      say, lawyers have no conscience, we mean no conscientiousness. They know
      right from wrong as men, but not professionally. It is with consciousness
      that the logician has to deal. Consciousness is the primary source of
      knowledge. Consciousness and the 'Evidences of the Senses' are synonymous
      terms. Facts referable to consciousness are said to be physically certain.
      The evidence of the senses is the highest standard of certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intuitive principles of belief are&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  1st. A conviction of our own existence.
  2nd. A confidence in the evidences of our senses.
  3rd. In our mental operations.
  4th. In our mental identity.
  5th. In the conformity of the operations of nature.
</pre>
    <p>
      These truths of intuition or consciousness are the foundation of all
      knowledge. Truths which we know, by way of inference, are occurrences
      which took place while we were absent&mdash;the events of history and the
      theorems of mathematics. But the truths known by intuition are the
      original premises from which all others axe inferred. Our assent to the
      conclusion being grounded upon the truth of the premises, we could never
      arrive at any knowledge by reasoning, unless something could be known
      antecedently to all reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever is known to us by consciousness, is known beyond possibility of
      question. What one sees, or feels, whether bodily or mentally, one cannot
      but be sure that one sees or feels. No science is required for the purpose
      of establishing such truths; no rules of art can render our knowledge of
      them more certain than it is in itself. There is no logic for this portion
      of our know ledge.'*
    </p>
    <p>
      All discussions pertaining to the nature and limits of intuition or
      consciousness are referred to the higher or transcendental metaphysics,
      but all the facts that compose evidence and become the grounds of
      inference are, according to the view taken here, necessarily subjects of
      examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cogito ergo sum&mdash;I think, therefore I am, argued Des Cartes. We
      learn by this that consciousness of the operations of the mind is the
      strongest evidence of our existence. It cannot be proved so forcibly by
      any other means; and although Des Cartes' language may appear to involve a
      logical fallacy, yet the proof of our personal existence which we have
      from <i>thinking</i>, is the fullest and best we are acquainted with.'**

    <p>
      There is a numerous class of facts from which all men draw conclusions,
      which facts are not referable to the evidence of the senses. There are the
      facts of testimony. Testimony is founded on laws almost as fixed and
      certain as those of nature. All our knowledge, scientific, literary,
      historical&mdash;all except what arises from our experience and
      consciousness&mdash;depends on it. In the administration of justice it is
      the sole guardian of property and life. If a man of known integrity and
      veracity state a fact, without any possible motive of self-interest, and
      evidently subject to no delusion; and if others of like character, who
      could have no understanding or collusion with him, state the same, men are
      nearly as certain of it as of any truth in mathematics. I believe in the
      existence of Rome and the facts of astronomy on this evidence, although I
      never saw the city or examined the stars through a telescope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusiveness of testimony is designated moral certainty. The value
      of testimony depends on three things. 1. On the nature of the subject.
      Some subjects are capable of more accurate observation than others. 2. On
      the powers and character of the observer&mdash;his ability to understand
      or note that of which he testifies&mdash;and his honesty in common
      matters. 3. On the number of our informers. Several persons are less
      likely to be imposed upon than one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Testimony or moral certainty is inferior to physical certainty. A physical
      certainty bears uniformly the name of certainty, while a moral certainty
      is characterised as a probability. Great, very great may be the
      probability, still it is less in reliableness than a physical certainty.
      The evidence of Cato or Aristides would be very conclusive&mdash;yet
      somewhat less certain than that which our own senses have proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusions from moral certainties are obtained like other
      conclusions, by induction. The induction from moral facts is like the
      induction from physical facts, with this difference&mdash;that the
      conclusions from moral facts are probabilities, like the facts on which
      they are founded. Whatever has physical certainty in its favour is
      considered demonstrable, and when sufficient probable evidence is adduced
      in favour of a proposition, it is considered to be fairly proved. Some
      persons, biased by the strictness of mathematical proof, insist upon the
      same accuracy in moral investigations. I have elsewhere pointed out the
      juvenility and infatuation of this error. Insist upon demonstration where
      the nature of the questions admits it. Less should not, in such case,
      suffice. Accept probability where probability is the sole evidence
      attainable. Never ask more than reason can grant. We must admit gradations
      of validity. What we are conscious of, we <i>know</i>. All we receive on
      testimony, we <i>believe</i>. Physical certainty is <i>knowledge</i>:
      moral certainty, <i>belief</i>. Hume remarks, in his 'Essay on
      Probabilities,' that 'Mr. Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative
      and probable. In this view, we must say, that it is only probable all men
      must die, or that the sun will rise to-morrow. But to conform our language
      more to common us, we ought to divide arguments into <i>demonstrations,
      proofs, and probabilities</i>. By proofs, meaning such arguments from
      experience as leave no room for doubt or opposition.'*

    <p>
      Conjecture is probable truth. Some subjects only furnish a sufficient
      number of facts to make them probable in the lowest degree&mdash;not to
      decide them as positively true. The propositions expressing results
      pertaining to such subjects are called conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conjecture founded on no fact or upon too few to make it likely, is
      called a vagary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen that probability is a thing of degree. A probability may
      vary in weight from a moral certainty, where it ranks next to a physical
      certainty, down to a conjecture, and descend lower in likelihood till it
      is lost in conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Kames remarks, in his preface to his 'Sketches'&mdash;'Most of the
      subjects handled in the following sheets, admit but of probable reasoning:
      and, with respect to such reasoning, it is often difficult to say, what
      degree of conviction they ought to produce. It is easy to form plausible
      arguments; but to form such as can stand the test of time, is not always
      easy. I could amuse the reader with numerous examples of conjectural
      arguments, which, fair at a distant view, vanish like a cloud on a near
      approach'. Did all authors so judiciously apprise their readers of the
      probable logical value of their speculations, fewer would be misled than
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      To numerous questions of undoubted interest, which have been agitated in
      all ages, only a moderate degree of certainty attaches&mdash;these are
      termed speculative. Such subjects may afford but few facts and instances,
      and the chances of conclusiveness may seem remote&mdash;yet ultimate
      results are not to be despaired of: the new comparison of conjectures and
      the arrangement of facts daily throws new light on age-contested points.
      Systems of conduct should not be founded on conjectures in opposition to
      evident moral utility; but if speculation is kept 'within the sphere of
      speculation, it may be prosecuted with safety and prospect of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are problems in metaphysics as there are in mathematics, which may
      be demonstrated to be insolvable. To describe the limit of human power
      with respect to contested questions will yet result from speculative
      controversy. The capacities of our understanding will be one day well
      considered, the extent of our knowledge discovered, and the horizon found
      which sets bounds between the enlightened and the dark part of things&mdash;between
      what is and what is not comprehensible by us. But this will only be when
      the <i>untried</i> has been <i>universally</i> attempted in all
      directions. Bailey, I think, has defined truth as being that which is
      universally accepted after having been universally examined. Little of
      this truth is yet extant. When every man shall be a thinker, when the
      autobiography of intellect shall be more freely furnished than it ever yet
      has been, unanimity of opinion not yet dreamed of will prevail. Harmony of
      opinion is the sign of intellectual conquest&mdash;the standard-bearer of
      truth no advocacy is victorious while dissent occupies the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we <i>know</i> to be true, is <i>knowledge</i>; what we have only
      reason to believe true, is <i>opinion</i>. All human information is made
      up of knowledge and opinion. The primary importance of knowledge is
      evident from the fact that knowledge is the umpire of all opinion. We
      believe in the existence of the ruins of Palmyra and Thebes, and in
      certain discoveries of algebraists and astronomers. It is our <i>opinion</i>
      that these things are true, although we may never have visited Palmyra or
      Thebes, nor made the calculations of the algebraist, nor the observations
      of the astronomer. In these cases our belief is founded on our <i>experience</i>
      and knowledge of mankind. It is quite true that travellers exaggerate, and
      scientific men are sometimes mistaken; but we know that there is always <i>some</i>
      truth at the bottom of what is communicated by well-meaning writers. More
      or less, every man's <i>experience</i> assures him of this; and it is the
      cause of our reliance on the records of history, and the reports of
      science. Therefore, since all information is made up of knowledge and
      opinion, plainly knowledge is the one thing which comprises all
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Questions of fact,' observes Pascal, in his celebrated 'Provincial
      Letters,' 'are only to be determined by the senses. If what you assert be
      true, prove it to be so; if it be not, you labour in <i>vain</i> to induce
      belief. All the authority in the world cannot enforce or alter belief as
      to facts; nothing can possibly have power to cause that not to be which
      actually <i>is</i>.'*
    </p>
    <p>
      A remarkable instance of the verification of what was assumed to be is
      related of Pascal by Goodrich. 'Pascal was a philosopher even in
      childhood. At a very early age he was taught the ten commandments. For
      several days after, he was observed to be measuring the growth of a blade
      of grass. When asked the meaning of this, he replied, "The fourth
      commandment says, 'Six days shalt thou labour, but the seventh is the
      Sabbath in which thou shalt do no work.' Now I wished to ascertain if
      nature obeyed this great law, and therefore measured the grass, to see if
      it grew as much on Sunday as on other days." '**
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are informed,' says Beattie, 'by Father Malebranche, that the senses
      were at first as honest faculties as one could desire to be endued with,
      till after they were debauched by original sin; an adventure from which
      they contracted such an invincible propensity to cheating, that they are
      now continually lying in wait to deceive us. But there is in man, it
      seems, a certain clear-sighted, stout, old faculty, called <i>reason</i>,
      which, without being deceived by appearances, keeps an eye upon the
      rogues, and often proves too cunning for them.'***

      Though it is so abundantly obvious that the evidences of our senses,
      internal and external, are, in effect, the sources of all certainty, yet
      we are not warranted in rejecting, as mere hypothesis, every theory which
      we cannot at once corroborate. When Euler remarked of his new law of
      arches, 'This will be found true, though contrary to all experience'&mdash;when
      Gall exclaimed of his new philosophy of the sensorium, 'This is true,
      though opposed to the philosophy of ages'&mdash;they expressed
      demonstrable truths hidden from the multitude. They announced new
      generalisations to man. New truths are commonly found to be old unnoted
      experiences, for the first time subjected to classification, and presented
      in a scientific form.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me it seems almost in vain to urge men to notice facts who have never
      noticed themselves. The truest standards of certainty arise from
      individuality of retrospection. An intelligent man is, himself to himself,
      the measure of all things in the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In appealing to the young on the aspiration after improvement, one cannot
      say 'Consult your aptitudes&mdash;follow your bias.' This Is the sole
      appeal-injunctive to which all natures can respond. But in this
      half-natured, half-trained, doubtfully-conditioned state of society,
      though the generous would be incited to noble deeds, the sordid would lay
      their vulture claws on the world, and the unprincipled victimise their
      fellows. You have, therefore, to say, 'Man, do what thou listest, provided
      it be compatible with the welfare of thy fellow men.' Men are not
      well-natured, and we have thus to guard individuality, and qualify the
      appeal, and so we miss the soil of great enterprise. Great is the
      disadvantage. For the fulcrum which is to raise men is without their
      natures&mdash;remote in the wide world.

      Man should begin with himself. He loves Truth&mdash;it is the first
      impulse of his nature. He loves Justice&mdash;the bandit on the throne, as
      well as the bandit in the forest, respects justice in some form or other.
      Man loves Cheerfulness&mdash;it is the attribute of innocence and courage.
      He loves Fraternity&mdash;it knits society together in brotherhood. These
      are standards. His codes of life and judgment arise from these
      aspirations. That which accords with these principles is <i>reasonable</i>.
      Whatever develops these principles in conduct is <i>moral</i>. These
      sentiments are to be confirmed by his own observations. His experience in
      connection with these rules is the right with which he may examine
      religions, creeds, books, systems, opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right understanding of physical and moral facts greatly depends upon
      intellectual character&mdash;and there enters largely into the recondite
      and ultimate inquiries of intelligent men another class of facts, called
      mental facts. There is no chance of identifying these without the power of
      self-analysis, which is one reason why metaphysic ability belongs to so
      few, and why questions involving metaphysical considerations are such
      profound enigmas to the majority of the people. The illiterate in these
      things are easily led or misled by words. They who will not bow before a
      throne fall prostrate before a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first principles of things are few. The axioms from which men date
      their reasoning are chiefly personal. They are expressed in an infinite
      variety of ways, occasioned by the various conceptions of those who
      conceive them, and by the different capacities to which they are adapted
      when offered for the instruction and guidance of others. But this must not
      mislead us as to the number, and overwhelm us with a sense of complexity,
      where in fact simplicity reigns. Those who have the power of self-analysis
      make for themselves rules of conduct, and the best are originated in this
      way&mdash;for when a man recasts his acquirements of sense and education,
      in order to see on what all rests, and what are essential standards of
      action and judgment, he resolves all into few, and those the clear and
      strong. Rob Roy's self-examination paper is presented to us in those lines
      which Sir Walter Scott, with grace and justice, characterised as the
      'high-toned poetry of his gifted friend Wordsworth.'

      Sir Walter Scott himself has enforced the same views:&mdash;'How much do I

      small voice leisure to be heard.

      To awaken the senses and instruct them and direct them aright in the art
      of observation, is a great and essential undertaking. All scattered aids
      need collecting together. De la Beche in 'Geology,' and Miss Martineau
      have written books, entitled 'How to Observe.' This quality is the
      distinction between the natural and artificial man&mdash;the natural man
      observes what is in nature&mdash;the artificial notes what he finds in
      books&mdash;the one depends on himself&mdash;the other on an
      encyclopaedia. We want contrast, in order to know as well as to explain.
      Foreigners observe us better than we observe ourselves. The common escapes
      our attention. To know a fact fully we seek its opposite to compare it
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were men reared with the powers of men without the genius of the child
      being impaired, the ability to observe would be more general and perfect
      among us. Children stop at everything to question its nature, at every
      word to ask its import. It was the aim of Pestalozzi to cultivate by his
      system of tuition this incessant questioning. But parents among the poor
      know not the value of the habit, or knowing it have not time to gratify
      it, and thus this happiest aptitude of childhood is repressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to the analysis of groups of facts, Mr. J. S. Mill remarks&mdash;'The
      observer is not he who merely sees the thing before his eyes, but he who
      sees what parts that thing is composed of. To do this well is a rare
      talent. One person from inattention, or attending only in the wrong place,
      overlooks half of what he sees; another sets down much more than he sees,
      confounding it with what he imagines, or with what he infers $ another
      takes note of the kind of all the circumstances, but being inexpert in
      estimating their degree, leaves the quantity of each vague and uncertain;
      another sees indeed the whole, but makes such an awkward division of it
      into parts, throwing things into one mass which require to be separated,
      and separating others which might more conveniently be considered as one,
      that the result is much the same, sometimes even worse, than if no
      analysis had been attempted at all.'*

      In the case of the Leigh Peerage there was a number of witnesses examined
      in the House of Lords, as to the existence of a certain monument in
      Stonely Church&mdash;'The first witness described the monument as being
      black; the second spoke of it as a kind of dove-colour; the third said it
      was black and white; the fourth said it was originally white, but dirty,
      when he saw it; the fifth differing from the others, said it was blue; the
      next witness described it as a light marble, but said it had a dark
      appearance as if it had been bronzed, and the last witness spoke of it as
      feeing of a light grey colour. Then, as to the form of the monument, the
      first witness said it was oblong; the next said it was square at the top,
      and came down narrower to the bottom, and there rested on a single truss;
      the third witness described it as being square at the bottom, testing upon
      two trusses; and went up narrower and narrower to a point at the top; the
      fourth witness said it was angular at the top; the next said it was square
      at the bottom, was brought to a point in the middle, and was then curved
      into a sort of festoon; the sixth witness stated that it was square at the
      top and bottom, and had a curve; and the last said it was square at the
      top and bottom. As to the language of the inscriptions, the first witness
      stated that the names of <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Christopher Leigh</i> were
      in English; the next said the inscription was not in English; the third
      said there was a great deal in English; the fourth witness said the whole,
      (with the exception of the name Christopher Lee), was in a language, which
      he did not understand; the next witness stated that the inscription was
      all in English, except the words <i>Anno Domini</i>; and the last witness
      said it was not in English.'*

      All these witnesses agree as to the fact in dispute, but their variances
      in testimony illustrate the common inattention of observation&mdash;and
      this case farther admonishes us that if such differences may exist as to a
      question of fact, where the senses are the same, little wonder that
      differences exist as to matters of opinion, where intellectual capacity
      and information are so various.

      We know from experience that the sportsman sees a point which is hidden
      from the unpractised aimer&mdash;the painter sees traits of character of
      light and shade in an object which the untaught limner never observes; the
      musician distinguishes harmonies and discords that fall unnoted on the
      uneducated ear.

      The extent is surprising to which the unanalytic are in ignorance of the
      real nature of phenomena. 'There is nothing which we appear to ourselves
      more directly conscious of, than the distance of an object from us. Yet it
      has long been ascertained, that what is perceived by the eye, is at most
      nothing more than a variously coloured surface; that when we fancy we see
      distance, all we really see is certain variation of apparent size, and
      more or less faintness of colour.'*

      In preparing to support an argument on any question, we must first
      determine the sources whence the facts are to be collected. Instance: The
      objects of municipal laws are rights and crimes.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
The evidence of rights are:&mdash;  1. Public consent.
  2. Testimony.
  3. Records.

      This outline of the investigation prosecuted, the inquirer next consults
      the authors who treat of the rules which are applied for determining the
      facts of public consent, testimony, records, confessions: he is then able
      to support his own argument in a valid manner, or prepared to examine the
      facts offered by an opponent in support of an opposite view.

    <p>
      The opinion may be hazarded that it is not so much from want of capacity
      to observe that error arises, as from the want of conviction that we
      should observe well before we attempt to infer. Nature is inventive, and
      desire, once awakened, will, without formal rules, find out a thousand
      modes of gratification. The foundation for a soldier logic than now
      prevails will be laid when the people are impressed with the great
      importance of looking well to facts as the data of all inferential truth.

      There is a noted aphorism of Cendillac, to the effect that the one
      sufficient rule for discovering the nature and properties of objects is to
      name them properly, as if, observes Mr. J. S. Mill, 'the reverse was not
      the truth, that it is impossible to name them properly except in
      proportion as we are already acquainted with their nature and properties.'
      Need it be added that this knowledge is only to be had by patient
      observation?

      To assist this habit, Dr. Watts recommends the thinker to ascertain if a
      given idea is clear and distinct, obscure and confused, learned or vulgar,
      perfect or imperfect, adequate or inadequate&mdash;true or false. 'View a
      subject, says he, as through a telescope, so as to command a clear view of
      it; examine its whole bearings as you look over a globe; consider it in
      its several properties&mdash;anatomise it as with a scalpel. Take
      cognizance of its various aspects as though inspecting it through a
      prismatic glass. Whenever we contemplate a single object in nature is
      obvious it must have duration, size, weight, form, colour, such qualities
      being essentially present in all adequate conceptions of physical
      phenomena.'

      It was objected to the 'Cricket' of Mr. Dickens, that his delineation of
      Bertha was wanting in truthfulness. The teachers of the blind who knew
      their nature could detect the departure from the reality of their habits
      in the sketch of Bertha. The study of the blind was necessary to insure
      success. We may not be able in any one book to give rules for the study of
      all subjects, but we may indicate that we ought not to speak of what we do
      not know, and that if we mean to introduce certain facts into our speech
      or writing, we should consult the records and experienee of those persons
      who are known to have written upon the subject, and follow the best
      directions they give, and we shall generally attain accuracy.

      Mr. Combe observes, in his introduction to his notes on the United States
      of North America, p. xi.&mdash;'I was told that a <i>certain person</i>
      boasts of having given Miss Martineau erroneous information for the
      purpose of leading her into mistakes; and another in Philadelphia assures
      his friends that he "crammed" Capt. Marryatt with old "Joe Millers," which
      the Capt. embodied into his books as facts illustrative of American
      manners. This seems to be a case in which some uncertainty must ever exist
      as to the value of the facts collected by travellers. They cannot observe
      all, or test half that they do observe. They must rely on testimony. But
      they might do this&mdash;They might tell us precisely the kind of
      authority they followed, and then the reader could form some opinion of
      the value of what was communicated. Had Miss Martineau and Captain
      Marryatt given the name and addresses of their informants, the latter
      would now be punished by being infamously known throughout Europe; and all
      future travellers warned from them&mdash;and all future informants warned
      by their example. Where informants cannot be mentioned by name and
      address, the chances are, they cannot be trusted. When first connected
      with public proceedings, I found myself made the depository of innumerable
      bits of scandal, and ominous reports of public characters. To all who told
      me anything, if I attached importance to it, I made it a rule to ask&mdash;'May
      I mention it to the party with your name?' 'O, no, I would rather not,'
      was the common reply. To all written communications answer&mdash;'Please
      add your name and address&mdash;and may I publish them if occasion
      requires?' 'O, no, don't,' would be the general injunction. Thus I found
      that huge reports, inflated as balloons, shrunk like them when pricked by
      the pin of a question&mdash;'Will you answer for it?' Thus I saved myself
      from being imposed upon by, or being the retailer of, reports for which
      the originator or relator would not or could not vouch.

      'Upwards of twenty years ago,' says George Combe, 'I accompanied a member
      of the bar of Paris, a philosopher and a man of letters, on a visit to the
      Highlands of Scotland. At Callendar a boy of twelve or thirteen years of
      age attended as a guide to some interesting spot, and in external
      appearance he seemed to be in every respect one of the common lads of the
      village. My Parisian friend entered into conversation with him; asked him
      if he had been at school, and soon discovered that to a tolerable
      acquaintance with the Greek and Latin languages, he added a pretty
      extensive-knowledge of arithmetic and geography, and was then engaged in
      the study of mathematics. My friend conceived that the boy was an average
      specimen of the peasantry of the country; and greatly admired the
      educational attainments of the Scotch people, which he had previously
      heard highly extolled. But,' adds Mr. Combe, 'the boy was the natural son
      of an English officer, who had resided in the neighbourhood, and who,
      while he ordered him to be reared in the hardy habits of the Scottish
      Highlanders, had provided ample funds for his mental education.'*

      It is difficult to believe in this Frenchman being a 'philosopher, making,
      as he did, a national induction from a single instance. Had he previously
      inquired, as he ought to have done, the particulars of that lad's life and
      rearing, before coming to so large a conclusion, he would at once have
      discovered the error he was falling into.

      In the Registrar General's Report of 1840, the mean of married persons
      unable to write is presented. The conclusion is based upon the statistics
      of nine counties. But when it was found that only three per cent, of the
      persons marriageable, did marry, the datum was found insufficient to
      afford sure results. This fact; is given by Mr. Combe in the same book.
      Then how many boys ought our 'philosopher' to have questioned before
      making his vast inference?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another instance of the value of a question I extract from the same work.
      Mr. Combe says:&mdash;'A few years ago, when travelling in Somersetshire,
      I saw four horses, attended by two men, drawing a light plough in a light
      soil. "What a waste of labour is here," said I to an intelligent farmer;
      "in Scotland, two horses and one man will accomplish this work." "We rear
      and train young horses for the London market," said he; "two of the four
      which you see are serving an apprenticeship to labour."' Had Mr. Combe
      asked a few questions as to the correctness of his assumed inference, he
      would have been saved from his erroneous conclusion. We should be wary of
      unquestioned data.

      When Murray's Grammar was first placed in my hands, I found in it certain
      references to the Canons of Language in the larger edition. I questioned
      my teacher as to what it meant. 'It is a trick of the printer,' he
      answered, 'to induce you to buy the larger volume.' I do not believe this
      now. I believe that it was a necessary reference. An author who has
      written upon a given subject, naturally finds his own ideas coincident
      illustrations of his views, and honestly refers to them. In this book I
      have made a few references to previous works of mine, and it has struck me
      that nine ont of ten of the readers will set this down to artifice or
      egotism. Yet it is neither. I have referred only to avoid the full
      quotation of some necessary illustration of the argument. Yet few will
      penetrate to the fact, and most will be apt to infer a trick from
      appearances.

      CHAPTER VI. SCIENCE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Whatever we know must be in the number of the primitive
     data, or of the conclusions which can be drawn therefrom.&mdash;
     J.S. Mill
</pre>
    <p>
      To have reached, in the study of observed phenomena, the point of
      perception indicated in this motto, and to feel the full force of the
      remark, is to have imbibed the spirit of science&mdash;-whose traits are
      dear distinctions, accurate classification, and strict reference to
      primitive data. The bases of all science are methodical facts. The first
      step to the perfection and enlargement of a science is the resolution of
      its propositions into axioms, and into propositions which are to be
      proved. Dr. Reid observes&mdash;'This has been done in mathematics from
      the beginning, and has tended greatly to the emolument of that science. It
      has lately been done in natural philosophy, and by this means that science
      has advanced more in 160 years than it had done before in 2,000. Every
      science is in an unformed state until its first principles are
      ascertained; after this it advances regularly, and secures the ground it
      has gained.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Classification is one of the first steps to Science. The maxim in
      government, divide and conquer, retains, when applied to science, all its
      wisdom without its machiavelialism. The young grammarian reduces the mass
      of words, that so threaten to confound his powers, to a few natural
      classes, and he conquers them separately with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The single power by which we discover resemblance or relation in general,
      is a sufficient aid to us in the perplexity and confusion of our first
      attempts at arrangement. It begins by converting thousands, and more than
      thousands, into one; and, reducing in the same manner the numbers tiros
      formed, it arrives at last at the few distinctive characters of those
      great comprehensive tribes, on which it ceases to operate, 'because there
      is nothing left to oppress the memory or the understanding.'*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

</pre>
    <p>
      Merell has spoken more comprehensively on this subject&mdash;'That human
      knowledge dees not consist in the bare collection and enumeration of
      facts; this alone would be of little service were we net to attempt the
      classification of them, and to educe from such classification general laws
      and principles. The knowledge, which consists in individual truths, could
      never be either extensive ear definite&mdash;for the multiplicity of
      objects which then must crowd in upon the mind only tends to confound and
      perplex it, while the memory, overburdened with particulars, is not able
      to retain a hundredth part of the materials which are collected. To
      prevent this, the power el generalisation comes to our aid, by which the
      individual facts are so classified under their proper conceptions, that
      they may at the same time be more easily retained, and their several
      relations to all other branches of knowledge accurately defined. The
      colligation and classification of facts, then, we may regard as the two
      first steps, which are to be taken in the attainment of truth.'*
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristotle, says Morell, classified the <i>matter</i>, Kant the <i>forms</i>.
      Aristotle was the first man who undertook the gigantic task of reducing
      the multiplicity of all the objects of human knowledge to a few general
      heads&mdash;-1. Substance. 2. Quality. 3. Quantity. 4. Relation. Action.
      6. Passion. 7. Place. 8. Time. 9. Posture. 10. Habit. Aristotle's
      philosophy was <i>objective</i>, Kant's <i>subjective</i>. Kant's
      categories were twelve. 1. Unity. 2. Plurality. 3. Totality. 4.
      Affirmation. Negation. 6. limitation. 7. Substance. 8. Casualty. 9.
      Reciprocity. 10. Possibility. 11. Actuality. 12. Necessity.

      'It is a fundamental principle in logic, that the power of framing classes
      is unlimited as long as there is any (even the smallest) difference to
      found a distinction upon.**
    </p>
    <p>
      What Geoffroy Saint Hilaire has said of natural history is applicable to
      all science:&mdash;'The first problem to be solved by him who wishes to
      penetrate deeply into this; study, consists evidently in the formation of
      clear and precise distinctions between the various brings. This is the
      most elementary problem, in so-far as it precedes all the others; but it
      is in reality, in most cases, complicated and full of difficulties. Its
      accurate solution requires&mdash;first, <i>Observation</i>, which makes
      known the facts; next, <i>Description</i>, which fixes them permanently;
      then <i>Characterisation</i>, which selects and displays prominently the
      most important of them&mdash;and lastly, <i>Classification</i>, which
      arranges them in systematic order.'***
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the value of classification, Lamartine has given a fine illustration:&mdash;&mdash;'Montesquieu
      had sounded the institutions and analysed the laws of all people. By <i>classing</i>
      governments he had compared them, by comparing them he passed judgment on
      them; and this judgment brought out, in its bold relief and contrast, on
      every page, right and force, privilege and equality, tyranny and
      liberty.'****

      Familiarity with the characteristics of science imparts considerable power
      for the detection of fallacy. A logician is imperfect without scientific
      tastes and habits. The man of science has all his knowledge systematised
      and arranged. What other people have in confusion, he has in order. The
      elements of knowledge are, more or less, as has been observed, known to
      all men&mdash;but in their perfect, communicable, and usable state, they
      are-known only to the educated and scientific man. What training is to the
      soldier, science is to the thinker. It enables him to control all his
      resources and employ his natural powers to the best advantage. It is this
      which constitutes the superiority of the educated over the ignorant.
      Astronomy, navigation, architecture, geometry, political economy, morals,
      all rest, or should rest, and do rest, if they have-attained to the
      perfection of science, on primary facts and first principles. Every step
      can be measured by an axiom&mdash;every result can be traced to a first
      principle.* To detect error, then, in any province of investigation, or
      any domain of argument, the logician first looks to the primary principles
      on which it is based, and thus tests the legitimacy of its conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As respects those who deal in things professedly above reason, It was well
      said by an anonymous writer of the old school of sturdy thinkers,&mdash;'Of
      such men as these I usually demand, whether their own assent to things
      they would have us believe, be grounded upon some <i>rational argument</i>.
      If they say 'tis not, they are fools to believe it themselves; and I
      should add to the number of fools, if, after this acknowledgment, I should
      believe them: but if they say it is, I desire them to produce their
      argument; for since 'tis framed by a human understanding, the force of it
      may also be comprehended and judged of by a human understanding: and tis
      to no purpose to say that the subject surpasses human reason: for if it do
      so indeed, it will surpass <i>theirs</i> as well as <i>mine</i>, and so
      leave us both upon even terms. And let the thing assented to be what it
      will, the assent itself must be founded upon a <i>sufficient reason</i>,
      and consequently upon one that is <i>intelligible</i> to the human
      intellect that is wrought on by it.'**

      "What is it?&mdash;" "'Tis impossible the same thing should be, and not be
      at the same time," are maxims of such universal usefulness, that without
      them we could neither <i>judge, discourse,</i> nor <i>act</i>. These
      principles may not always make their appearance in formal propositions,
      but still they guide all our thoughts in the same manner as when a
      musician plays a careless voluntary upon a harpsichord&mdash;he is guided
      by rules of music he long since became familiar with, though now scarcely
      sensible of them.

      'A butcher loses his knife, and looks all about for it, and remarks as the

      rude saying it is evident he is guided by the axiom last mentioned. Had he
      not the knowledge of this axiom beforehand, did he think it possible that
      his knife could be <i>no where</i> or in <i>no place</i> he would never
      take pains to look for it. We may observe many such axioms as this guiding
      the actions of the vulgar, and it is no unworthy speculation to observe
      their behaviour and words, which proceed from uncorrupted nature, and
      retrieve the axioms from which their conduct proceeds.'*

      The outlines of the science of morality are thus comprehensively sketched
      by Sir James Mackintosh: the origin, value, and application of first
      principles are indicated with his usual felicity. 'The usages and laws of
      nations, the events of history, the opinions of philosophers, the
      sentiments of orators and poets, as well as the observations of common
      life, are in truth, the materials out of which the science of morality to
      formed; and those who neglect them are justly chargeable with a vain
      attempt to philosophise without regard to fact and experienee&mdash;the
      sole foundation of all true philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural order undoubtedly dictates that we should first search for the
      <i>original principles</i> of the science in human nature; then apply them
      to the regulation of the conduct of individuals, and lastly employ them
      for the decision of those difficult and complicated questions that arise
      with respect to the intercourse of nations.'
    </p>
    <p>
      To search for ultimate principles is to discover at a glance the whole
      bearings of a great question. Through what clouds of politics had the
      historian of Rome penetrated when he announced that the principles of a
      free constitution are irrecoverably lost when the legislative power is
      nominated by the executive.
    </p>
    <p>
      This habit&mdash;it cannot be too often insisted on aids not only the
      acquisition of knowledge, but also its <i>retention</i>. Around these
      first principles, as around a standard, the thoughts naturally associate.
      Touch but a remote chord of any question, and it will vibrate to the
      central principle to which it has once been well attached. Every relative
      impression owns a kindred connection, and the moment one is attacked, it,
      like a faithful sentinel, arouses a whole troop, which, marshalled and
      disciplined, bear down and challenge the enemy.'*

      CHAPTER VII. PROPOSITIONS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     All truth and all error lie in Propositions.&mdash;J. S. Mill.
</pre>
    <p>
      In accordance with that experience which directs to the profoundest books
      for the simplest statements, we turn to Mill's Logic for the philosophy of
      propositions. The answer to every question which it is possible to frame
      is contained in a proposition or assertion. Whatever can be an object of
      belief or even of disbelief, must, when put into words, assume the form of
      a proposition * * What we call a truth is simply a true proposition; and
      errors are false propositions. To know the import of all possible
      propositions would be to know all questions which can be raised, all
      matters which are susceptible of being either believed or disbelieved. * *
      Since then the objects of all belief and all inquiry express themselves in
      propositions, a sufficient scrutiny of propositions and of their varieties
      will apprise us what questions mankind have asked themselves, and what it
      the nature of the answers to those questions they have actually thought
      they had grounds to believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now the first glance at a proposition shows that it is formed by putting
      together two names. A proposition, according to the common simple
      definition, which is sufficient for our purpose, is, <i>discourse in which
      something is affirmed or denied of something</i>. Thus, in the
      proposition, gold is yellow, the quality <i>yellow</i> is affirmed of the
      substance <i>gold</i>. In the proposition, Franklin was not born in
      England, the fact expressed by the words <i>born in England</i> is denied
      of the man Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Every proposition consists of three parts: the subject, the predicate,
      and the copula. The predicate is the name denoting that which is affirmed
      or denied. The subject is the name denoting the person or thing which
      something is affirmed or denied of. The copula is the sign denoting that
      there is an affirmation or denial; and thereby enabling the hearer or
      reader to distinguish a proposition from any other kind of discourse.
      Thus, in the proposition, the earth is round, the predicate is the word <i>round</i>,
      which denotes the quality affirmed, or (as the phrase is) predicated: <i>the
      earth</i> words denoting the object which that quality is affirmed of,
      compose the subject; the word it, which serves as the connecting mark
      between the subject and predicate, to show that one of them is affirmed of
      the other, is called the copula.'

      CHAPTER VIII. DEFINITIONS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     No difficulty is unsurmountable, if words be allowed to pass
     without meaning.&mdash;Lord Kames.
</pre>
    <p>
      As every proposition consists of two names, and as every proposition
      affirms or denies one of these names of the other, the value of
      definition, which fixes the import of names, is apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A <i>name</i> is a word taken at pleasure to serve for a mark, which may
      raise in our mind a thought like to some thought we had before, and which
      being pronounced to others, may be to them a sign of what thought the
      speaker had before in his mind [Hobbes]. This simple definition of a name,
      as a word (or set of words) serving the double purpose of a mark to recall
      to ourselves the likeness of a former thought, and a sign to make it known
      to others, appears unexceptionable.'*
    </p>
    <p>
      Definition originates in accurate and comprehensive observation. 'There
      cannot be,' says Mill, 'agreement about the definition of a thing, until
      there is agreement about the thing itself. <i>To define a thing is to
      select from among the whole of its properties those which shall be
      understood to be designated and declared by its name</i>; and the
      properties must be very well known to us before we can be competent to
      determine which of them are fittest to be chosen for this purpose.'**
    </p>
    <p>
      'The simplest and most correct notion of a definition is, a proposition
      declaratory of the meaning of a word; namely, either the meaning which it
      bears in common acceptation, or that which the speaker or writer, for the
      particular purposes of his discourse, intends to annex to it.'***

</pre>
    <p>
      But with most persons the object of a definition is merely to guide them
      to the correct use of a term as a protection against applying it in a
      manner inconsistent with custom and convention. Anything, therefore, is to
      them a sufficient definition of a term which will serve as a correct index
      to what the term denotes; although not embracing the whole, and sometimes
      perhaps not even any part of what it connotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Definitions are sometimes explained as being of two kinds&mdash;of things
      and words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition of <i>words</i> is the explanation of the sense in which
      they are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition of <i>things</i> is an explanation of the specific
      properties by which they differ from all other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      To define a thing, says Dr. Watts, we must ascertain with what it agrees,
      then note the most remarkable attribute of difference, and join the two
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probity&mdash;the disposition to acknowledge the rights of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Justice&mdash;the disposition to maintain the rights of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benevolence&mdash;the disposition to improve the rights of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deceit&mdash;the concealed violation of the rights of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Injustice&mdash;the open violation of the rights of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malevolence&mdash;hatred of the rights of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In defining a word we seek some class to which to refer it, that we may
      identify it, and fix attention upon that peculiarity by which we can
      distinguish it from all other things. 'Probity and 'justice' are referred
      to 'disposition,' with reference to the 'rights of mankind' as their
      sphere of existence: and <i>acknowledgment, and maintenance</i>, are
      mentioned as the distinguishing features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distinctions must not be made without differences. The definition should
      be plainer than the thing defined. Aristotle's definition of motion is
      considered defective in this respect:&mdash;'Motion&mdash;an act of a
      being in power, so far forth as it is in power.' Tautological definitions
      cause more to be supposed than is true&mdash;the too terse explanation
      leaves some necessary thing unmentioned. A perfect definition requires the
      union of the concise, the clear, and the adequate. Some persons are so
      unskilful in the analysis of terms as to occasion the advice <i>Nil
      explicare</i>&mdash;never explain yourself if you wish to be understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Double meanings should be avoided. The writer may himself alternate in
      their use, and the reader may take the word in the unintended meaning. All
      men have not the strong sense of Johnson. When Caleb Whiteford inquired
      seriously of the Doctor, whether he really considered that a man ought to
      be transported, like Barrington, the pickpocket, for being guilty of a
      double meaning. 'Sir,' said Johnson, 'if a man means well, the more he
      means the better'&mdash;which, whether real or fictitious, is one of the
      happiest answers that ever crushed a quibble.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Hood's Own.

    <p>
      I have frequently put the question&mdash;What is consciousness? to persons
      who have been conscious for twenty or thirty years, but who were yet
      unable to reply. Had any one deprived these persons of consciousness, a
      judge would have hanged him for the offence; yet, could they themselves
      have been interrogated as to what harm they had suffered, they could not
      have told what they had lost. And upon the principle, that he not knowing
      what he has lost, is no loser, these persons, though murdered, had
      suffered no harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various definitions of the same subject which prevail, originate in
      the caprice, or partial, or profound knowledge the definer may have of his
      subject. It seems to be admitted by logicians, that an author has a right
      to give whatever provisional definition he pleases of his terms. But
      having once given them, perspicuity requires that he should adhere to
      them. Any new sense in which a term is employed should be specially
      defined. In discoursing on an ordinary subject, as the right of public
      assembly,&mdash;such words as perception, conception, apprehension, might
      be used reciprocally, but in a dissertation on metaphysics each requires
      restriction in use and precision in purport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often genius strikes out new relations of words. In recent political
      debates, Mr. Cobden resorted with new force and point to a charge of
      rashness against ministers: he showed that rashness consisted more
      frequently in inaction than action. He is rash who stands surrounded by
      the elements of danger without taking; any precaution against the
      contingencies of peril; he is rash who does not take advantage of the
      calm, to repair his shattered rigging; he is rash who looks not out for a
      proper supply of water until the conflagration is raging around him; and
      more rash than all is he who exercises no provident care for supplying a
      nation with food, but waits for the pressure of famine and the perils of
      starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the last soiree of the Leeds Mechanics' Institution, Mr. Dickens
      referred to ignorance, commonly considered as a passive negation, and
      placed it in the light of a power. 'Look where we will, do we not find
      ignorance powerful for every kind of wrong and evil? Powerful to take its
      enemies to its heart and strike its best friends down&mdash;powerful to
      fill the prisons, the hospitals, and the graves&mdash;powerful for blind
      violence, prejudice, and error in all their destructive shapes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The variations which not only common but technical terms undergo, is a
      considerable source of perplexity in reasoning. Mr. Mill cites the
      instance of the term felony. No lawyer will undertake to tell what a
      felony is otherwise than by enumerating the various kinds of offences
      which are so called. Originally, felony denoted all offences, the penalty
      of which included forfeiture of goods; but, subsequent Acts of Parliament
      have declared various offences to be felonies without enjoining that
      penalty, and have taken away the penalty from others which continue still
      to be called felonies, insomuch that the acts so called have now no
      property whatever in common, save that of being unlawful and punishable.
      This inattention to precision in terms has arisen not among the vulgar,
      but among educated English lawyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Language,' says Mr. Mill, borrowing a political simile from Sir James
      Mackintosh, '"is not made, but grows." A name not unfrequently passes by
      successive links of resemblance from one object to another, until it
      becomes applied to things having nothing in common with the first things
      to which the name was given; which, however, do not, for that reason, drop
      the name; so that it at last denotes a confused huddle of objects, having
      nothing whatever in common; and connotes nothing, not even a vague and
      general resemblance. When a name has fallen into this state, in which by
      predicating it of any object we assert literally nothing about the object,
      it has become unfit for the purposes either of thought or of the
      communication of thought; and can only be made serviceable by stripping it
      of some part of its multifarious denotation, and confining it to objects
      possessed of some attributes in common, which it may be made to connote.
      Such are the inconveniences of a language which "is not made, but grows."
      like a road which is not made, but has made itself, it requires continual
      mending in order to be passable.'*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Logic, p. 207.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is well observed, that the spontaneous growth of language is of the
      utmost importance to the thinker. There seems to be so palpable a
      substratum of right sense, in the rude classifications of the multitude,
      that the logician has little else to do, in many cases, than to retouch
      them and give them precision. Guizot observes, there is frequently more
      truth in common acceptations of general terms than in the more precise
      definitions of science. Common sense gives to words their ordinary
      signification. The leading terms of philosophy are clothed in innumerable
      shades of meaning acquired in their transitional use, and immense is the
      knowledge of <i>thing:</i> requisite to enable a man to affirm that any
      given argument turns wholly on <i>words</i>. The study of terms, for which
      logicians have provided multiplied means, is one of the most interesting
      and profitable upon which men can enter. If it be worth while to speak at
      all, it is worth while to know certainly what we speak about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philanthropic genius has pointed out a perversion of power, arising
      through definitional incapacity, which makes it a moral duty to study
      analysis of terms, and exactitude of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      'All battle,' says Carlyle, 'is <i>misunderstanding</i>&mdash;did the
      parties know one another, the battle would cease. No man at bottom means
      injustice; he contends for some distorted image of right. <i>Clear</i>,
      undeniable right&mdash;<i>clear</i>, undeniable might&mdash;either of
      these, once ascertained, puts an end to battle. Battle is a confused
      experiment to ascertain these.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the power of names to impose on the multitude, history furnishes too
      many examples. Strength to forefend us against they delusion ability to
      see that the meaning governs the term, and not the term the meaning&mdash;are
      species of intellectual self-defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Augustus,' says Gibbon, 'was sensible that mankind is governed by names;
      nor was he deceived in his expectation that the senate and people would
      submit to slavery provided that they were respectably assured that they
      still enjoyed their ancient freedom.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never,' adjures W. J. Fox, 'be deceived by words. Always try to penetrate
      to realities. Have your wits sharpened, your senses exercised to discern
      good and evil. Be not imposed upon by pompous manners. Many a
      solemnly-uttered sentence is often a sheer inanity, which will not bear
      the scrutiny of an observant intellect. Be not frightened by
      denunciations; by being told that you are not a good subject or a good
      Christian, if you do not believe, or say that you believe this or that. Be
      not led astray by iteration&mdash;mistake not the familiar for the
      intelligible. Ascertain what words are meant to convey, and what they
      actually do convey. Go to the substance and soul of whatever is
      propounded. Be on your guard against bold assumptions, nor let them bear
      you away against the dictates of your own understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at phrases as counters, or paper money, that may pass for much or
      little according to circumstances. Endeavour to arrive at truth, and make
      that your treasure. Be ever wide awake to see through any veil of
      sophistry and cant; nor by the agency of words be made the dupe of critic
      or lawyer, of priest of politician.'*

      Reasoning is a simple business. To reason is to state facts in support of
      a proposition. A conclusive fact so advanced is called a reason. All the
      reasons offered in proof of a proposition are called premises. The
      Pythagorean, who lays down the proposition that fruits and grain are the
      proper food of man, and cites facts to prove his assertion&mdash;reasons.
      A proposition and its reasons are called an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reason is the faculty of perceiving coherences. Effective reasoning is
      stating them so that others cannot but see them too. 'Reasoning on the
      abstrusest questions is nothing more than arriving at a remote truth by
      discovering its coherence with the preceding facts in the same chain.'*

      A syllogism is a peculiar <i>form</i> of expression, in which every
      argument may be stated. It consists of three propositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Whoever have their heads cut off ought to be allowed to ask the reason
      why.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Women have their heads cut off.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Therefore women ought to be allowed to ask (politically) the reason
      why.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an argument of Mad. de Stael, in allusion to the beheading of
      women in France, without allowing them any voice in making the laws which
      determine the offences for which they suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A syllogism is constructed upon the principle (known as the Dictum of
      Aristotle) that whatever is affirmed or denied universally of a whole
      class of things, may be affirmed or denied of anything comprehended in
      that class. Thus the first proposition introduces the class of persons who
      have their heads cut off. Of this class it is affirmed that they ought to
      be allowed to ask the reason why. But women are included in the class of
      persons who have their heads cut off, and consequently that may be
      affirmed of them which is affirmed of the whole class&mdash;that they
      should be allowed to ask the reason why.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To prove an affirmative,' says Mr. Mill, 'the argument must admit of
      being stated in this form:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      All animals are mortal;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  All men        |

  therefore

  All men        |
  Some men       }    are mortal.
  Socrates       |
</pre>
    <p>
      'To prove a negative, the argument must be capable of being expressed in
      this form:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'No one who is capable of self-control is necessarily vicious;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  All negroes        |
  Some negroes       }   are capable of self-control;

  therefore

  No negroes are           |
  Some negroes are not     }   necessarily vicious.
  Mr. A.'s negro is not    |

      'Although all ratiocination admits of being thrown into one or the other
      of these forms, and sometimes gains considerably by the transformation,
      both in clearness and in the obviousness of its consequence; there are, no
      doubt, cases in which the argument falls more naturally into one of the
      other three figures, and in which its conclusiveness is more apparent at
      the first glance in those figures, than when reduced into the first. Thus,
      if the proposition were that pagans may be virtuous, and the evidence to
      prove it were the example of Aristides; a syllogism in the third figure,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Aristides was virtuous,
  Aristides was a pagan,
</pre>
    <p>
      therefore
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Some pagan was virtuous,
</pre>
    <p>
      Would be a more natural mode of stating the argument, and would carry
      conviction more instantly home, than the same ratiocination strained into
      the first figure, thus&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Aristides was virtuous,
 Some pagan was Aristides,
</pre>
    <p>
      therefore
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Some pagan was virtuous.'
</pre>
    <p>
      The best thing that can be said in favour of the syllogism, as an
      instrument of reasoning, is that it is a regular form to which every valid
      argument can be reduced; and may be accompanied by a rule, showing the
      validity of every argument in that form, and consequently the unsoundness
      of any apparent argument which cannot be reduced to it. This would be high
      praise if every 'valid argument' was a trusty one. But unfortunately 'the
      question respecting the validity of an argument is not whether the
      conclusion be <i>true</i>, but whether it <i>follows</i> from the premises
      adduced.'* Even this small advantage is purchased at a greater expense of
      tedium and trouble than the bulk of mankind are willing to pay, or able to
      pay if they were willing.

    <p>
      There is some reason to believe that the syllogistic form, as a <i>test</i>
      of valid arguments, may be entirely dispensed with, if we can secure
      accuracy of data, and intelligibility in terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not contended now that we discover new truths by the syllogism. The
      syllogism is allowed to be only a form of <i>stating</i> a truth. Example:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  No predacious animals are ruminant,
  The lion is predacious,
</pre>
    <p>
      therefore
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The lion is not ruminant.

     * Whately's Logic, Anal. Out. chap. 1, sec. 3.
</pre>
    <p>
      Of course, if we know that no animal that lives by prey chews the cud, and
      know, also, that the lion lives by prey, we know that the lion does not
      chew the cud. This conclusion, as Lord Kames contends, and Dr. Whately
      admits, is not a truth <i>inferred</i> from the fundamental premises, but
      <i>included</i> in it. Smart, whom Mr. J. S. Mill calls acute and often
      profound, remarks&mdash;'Every one, as to the <i>mere</i> act of
      reasoning, <i>reasons rightly</i>: we may reason from wrong premises, or
      mistake right ones; we may be unable to infer from proper ones; but from
      such premises as we do reason from, we reason <i>correctly</i>: for all
      premises contain their conclusion; and in knowing the premises, we
      therefore know the conclusion. The art wanted is one that will enable us
      to use language perspicuously in expressing our premises:' and he might
      have added&mdash;<i>direct us in selecting proper materials of which to
      make premises</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strength and weakness of the syllogism as an instrument of reasoning
      will now be understood. Whately remarks, that 'since all reasoning may be
      resolved into syllogisms, and since in a syllogism the premises do
      virtually assert the conclusion, it follows at once that no new truth can
      be elicited by any process of reasoning.'* We therefore no longer look to
      the syllogism to discover truth, its value is in stating it. In this sense
      it is worthy of all attention. It is the form of nature.

      It has been insisted by some logicians that the genius required for its
      construction was <i>invention</i>. Having made a general proposition like
      the first, we then have to invent or find out a middle term as the second&mdash;but
      if we bear in mind that the general affirmation of the first proposition
      relates to a class of (predacious animals in this case) objects which
      include the middle term, the necessity of invention is consequently
      dispensed with. We need only look well to what we have there. Simplicity
      will be promoted by returning to our previous remark, viz.&mdash;that
      reasoning is asserting a proposition, and then showing why it is true&mdash;in
      other words, adducing the fact or facts, on which the assertion rests.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Logic given in 'Chambers' Information,' it is said&mdash;' In
      choosing your middle terms, or arguments to prove any question, always
      take such topics as are purest and least fallible, and which carry the
      greatest evidence and strength with them,' But it rather appears that we
      have not to invent a middle term, but only to look to the major premises,
      and find it included there.
    </p>
    <p>
      By methodical questioning any argument may be tested. Thus, on any
      assertion being made, ask&mdash;Why is the assertion true? In this manner,
      if an argument has truth in it, it may be elicited. In this manner you dig
      through assertions down to premises, and discover whether any ore of truth
      lies there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The value of the argument depends upon the final answer which reveals the
      premises or data of facts, upon which the conclusion rests. Forms of
      speech, classification of propositions, figures of syllogisms, are of
      minor importance when you have once elicited the rough truth. The best
      test of an argument is the soundness of its data, and the simplest formula
      for drawing out and exhibiting such data, is of the greatest service in
      enabling us to judge of the validity thereof.
    </p>

      Tyranny, says Cobbett, has no enemy so formidable as the pen, Why?
      'Because the pen pursues tyranny both in life and beyond the grave.' How
      is this proved to be the most formidable enemy of tyranny? 'From the fact
      that tyranny has no enemy so formidable as that which assails not only its
      existence, but its reputation, which pursues it in life and beyond the
      grave.' Such interrogatories and replies generate the expository
      syllogism.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Tyranny has no enemy so formidable as that which assails not only its
      existence, but its reputation, which pursues it in life and beyond the
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The pen pursues tyranny in life and beyond the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Therefore, tyranny has no enemy so formidable as the pen. A syllogism
      is made up of collective and single facts. It is the process of reasoning,
      whereby we show that a single truth is proved by a collective one which
      contains it, or a less quantity is proved by a greater, or that an
      assertion is proved by an induction from a class of facts. From the class
      of the enemies of tyranny the pen is selected, and is proved, by passing
      in inductive review the whole class, to be the most formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual manner in which an argument is presented is called the
      entihymeme. Thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He is an industrious man,
</pre>
    <p>
      therefore
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He will acquire wealth.
</pre>
    <p>
      The first or major proposition is in this form suppressed. The syllogistic
      form would be this:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Every industrious man acquires wealth,
  He is an industrious man,
</pre>
    <p>
      therefore
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He will acquire wealth.
</pre>
    <p>
      But if we ask for the proof that every industrious man acquires wealth, we
      find the facts wanting&mdash;for the idle are often rich, and the diligent
      poor. The industrious <i>may</i> acquire wealth, the chances are in their
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We must cherish self-respect,
  Because self-respect is the stay of virtue.
</pre>
    <p>
      The suppressed proposition is&mdash;'We must cherish whatever is the stay
      of virtue.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole syllogism then stands thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We must cherish whatever is the stay of virtue,
  Self-respect is the stay of virtue,
</pre>
    <p>
      therefore
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We must cherish self-respect.

      Dilemma is derived from a Greek word, and signifies twice an argument. It
      is an argument divided into several members, and infers of each part what
      is to be inferred of the whole. Thus: Either we shall live or die. If we
      live, we can only live happily by being virtuous; and if we die, we can
      only die happy by being virtuous; therefore, we ought always to be
      virtuous. In the dilemma, question one argument at a time, as in preceding
      cases.

      The Sorites uses several middle terms by which the predicate of the last
      proposition is connected with the first subject. Of this argument the
      well-known speech of Themistocles is a specimen. 'My son,' said that
      eminent person, 'governs his mother, his mother governs me, I govern the
      Athenians, the Athenians govern Greece, Greece governs Europe, and Europe
      governs the world; therefore, my son governs the world.' In these
      instances, question each assertion, as there are as many acts of reasoning
      as intermediate propositions.

      The Onus Probandi, or Burden of Proof, is said to rest with him who would
      dispute any point in favour of a presumptive, or generally allowed truth.

      asserts, the honest reasoner should be prompt to prove.

      Chalmers, it is said, made Morell known&mdash;but Morell has written a
      synopsis of metaphysical philosophy that only needed to be known to be
      appreciated. If Chalmers gave Morell distinction, Morell had previously
      earned it. From his work I extract the following passage, which passes in
      review the steps taken, marks the analytic point reached, and outlines the
      ground before us:&mdash;'Different as were the minds of those two great
      men [Bacon and Descartes] in themselves, different as were their
      respective labours, and opposite as were, in many respects, the results at
      which they arrived, yet the writings of both were marked by one and the
      same great characteristic, namely, by the <i>spirit of method</i>. The
      most important works of Bacon, it will be remembered, were the
      "Instanratio Magna," and the "Novum Organum;" those of Descartes were his
      "Dissertatio de Methodo," and his "Meditationes de Prima Philosophia," The
      fruitlessness of the ancient logic, as an instrument of discovery, had
      been abundantly proved by past experience, and the watchword which these
      two great thinkers of their age both uttered, and which has been ever
      since the guiding principle of all philosophy, was&mdash;analysis. Bacon,
      who gave his attention chiefly to the direction and improvement of
      physical science, taught to analyse nature, while Descartes, who aimed
      rather at grounding all human knowledge upon its ultimate principles,
      instructed how to analyse <i>thought</i>. All modern philosophy,
      therefore, whether it arise from the Baconian or the Cartesian point of
      view, bears upon it the broad outline of the analytic method. It matters
      not whether it be the outer or the inner world to which its investigations
      apply, in each case it teaches us to observe and analyse <i>facts</i> to
      induce instances, and upon such observation and induction to ground our
      knowledge of laws and principles. In this alone consists the Unity of
      modern science, and from this arises its broad distinction from that of
      the ancient world. Every natural philosopher since Bacon has grounded his
      success upon an induction of the facts of the outward world, and every
      metaphysician, since Descartes, has progressed onwards in his department
      of knowledge by analysing the facts of our inward consciousness.'*

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. INDUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Induction is an inference from many facts. Induction is verification. Just
      as in a syllogism we show that a part is contained in the whole, so in
      induction we show that a part is illustrated by the whole. It seems that
      every single fact contains many truths, but induction establishes their <i>universality</i>.
      A single brain contains all the truths of phrenology, a single stone
      includes the phenomena of gravitation, the temperance of a single
      individual exhibits the whole law of moderation, but we learn the
      universality of these truths by induction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every legal statute, says Dr. Johnson, is founded on induction. 'Law is
      the science in which the greatest powers of understanding are applied to
      the greatest number of facts.' The <i>basis of all</i> science is such an
      extensive induction of particulars as leads to general definitions and
      fundamental axioms, and furnishes the premises from which inferences may
      be deduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inductive observation is the great instrument of discovering important
      truths. 'What are called the principles of human nature are learned from
      individual instances. It is the only possible way of learning them. * *
      When we reason from a general law or principle, we are in truth reasoning
      from a number of instances represented by It.'*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Rationale of Political Representation, p. 34.
</pre>
    <p>
      A general election is an induction of the intelligence of the country
      represented by the members of Parliament. The difference between democracy
      and monarchy is in one sense an affair of logic. Where electors are
      limited in franchise, and candidates restricted by property qualification,
      the induction is partial, but where all can vote and many can be chosen
      from, the premises are more capacious and the inference sounder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Whately says, that 'in Natural Philosophy a <i>single instance</i> is
      often accounted a <i>sufficient</i> induction; e.g., having once
      ascertained that an individual magnet will attract iron, we are authorised
      to conclude that this property is universal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The Edinburgh Reviewer of Whewell's "History of the Inductive Sciences,"
      observes that, "by the <i>accidental</i> placing of a rhomb of calcareous
      spar, upon a book or line, Bartholinus discovered the property of the
      double refraction of light. By <i>accidentally</i> combining two rhombs in
      different positions, Huygens discovered the polarisation of light. By <i>accidentally</i>
      looking through a prism of the same substance, and turning it round, Mains
      discovered the polarisation of light by reflection; and by placing thin
      chrystalline films between two similar prisms or rhombs, M. Arago
      discovered the phenomena of polarised tints."
    </p>
    <p>
      'To this Mr. Whewell, in his "Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences," makes
      the following reply:&mdash;"But Bartholinus could have seen no such
      consequence in the accident, if he had not previously had a clear
      conception of single refraction. A lady, in describing an optical
      experiment which had been shown her, said of her teacher, 'he told me to
      increase and diminish the angle of refraction: and, at last, I found that
      he only meant me to move my head up and down.' At any rate, till the lady
      had acquired a knowledge of the meaning which the technical terms convey,
      she could not have made Bartholinus's discovery by means of this accident.
      Suppose that Huygens made the experiment alluded to, without design, what
      he really observed was that the images appeared and disappeared
      alternately as he turned the rhomb round. His success depended on his
      clearness of thought, which enabled him to perform the intellectual
      analysis which would never have occurred to most men, however often they
      had combined two rhombs in different positions. Malus saw that in some
      positions the light reflected from the windows of the Louvre became dim.
      Another person would have attributed this to accident; he, however,
      considered the position of the prism, and the window; repeated the
      experiment often; and by virtue of the eminently distinct conceptions of
      space which he possessed, resolved the phenomenon into its geometrical
      conditions."* "If it were true, that the fall of an apple was the occasion
      of Newton's pursuing that train of thought which led to the doctrine of
      universal gravitation, the habits and constitution of Newton's intellect
      were the real source of this great event in the progress of knowledge."**
      "In whatever manner facts may be presented to the notice of a discoverer,
      they can never become the materials of exact knowledge, except they find
      his mind already provided with precise and suitable conceptions, by which
      they may be analysed and connected."'***

      These admissions seem to me to prove that whenever a casual fact proves to
      us a new truth, it does so by its coincidence with previously known facts,
      and that the novelty of the occasion attracts all credit to itself, and we
      lose sight of the generalisation below&mdash;the fruitful soil of
      experience on which the new fact, like a seed, falls. We only recognise
      difference by comparison, and the comparison is an induction, however
      slender.

      Monsieur de Montmorine was recaptured and brought to the scaffold, through
      the trifling circumstance of some chicken bones being found near the door
      of his landlady&mdash;a woman too poor to indulge in such dainties.* The
      discovery of de Montmorine was not, as at first sight appears, an
      inference from a single fact, but from an adjacent induction. It was a
      general truth, (known to the party who observed the bones) a truth
      inducted from a number of facts that poor people could not afford to
      luxuriate on chickens. It was, therefore, from this induction, inferred
      that some one of superior fortune must be living in that particular place.

      The judicious care which the great fathers of science have exhibited in
      making their inferences, incontestably establishes their conviction of the
      danger of any other reasoning than that from inductions. Lord Brougham
      informs us, that what Newton's Principia is to science, Locke's essay to
      metaphysics, Demosthenes in oratory, and Homer in poetry, Cuvier's
      researches to our fossil osteology. But Cuvier never attempted to draw any
      inferences until he had examined the <i>whole</i> osteology of the living
      species.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Brougham remarks, that 'from examining a <i>single</i> fragment of
      bone we infer that, in the wilds where we found it, there lived and
      ranged, some thousands of years ago, an animal of a peculiar kind.' This
      is a case in which the inference spoken of is arrived at in a way
      different from that apparently stated. We recognise in the 'fragment of
      bone' a link in a chain of facts constituting the basis of a well-known
      induction, which comparative anatomy has many times verified. It is
      important to distinguish well the grounds from which accurate inferences,
      such as these in the cases before us, have really been adduced, in order
      to ascertain the grounds from which we should reason generally. It will be
      found that solid reasoning can only proceed from general rules&mdash;i.e.,
      inductions from facts. It will be found that the prime source of fallacy
      lies in reasoning from isolated facts. It is not to be denied that such
      reasoning is sometimes right, but it is to be remembered that it is right
      by accident, not by design. There is no science or certainty in it. It is
      hazard, not logic.

      This habit however, is very common. Mr. Mill says, that 'Not only <i>may</i>
      we reason from particulars to particulars, without passing through
      generals, but we perpetually do so reason. All our earliest inferences are
      of this nature. From the first dawn of intelligence we draw inferences,
      but years elapse before we learn the use of general language. The child,
      who, having burnt his fingers, avoids to thrust them again into the fire,
      has reasoned or inferred, though he has never thought of the general maxim&mdash;fire
      burns. He knows from memory that he has been burnt, and on this evidence
      believes, when he sees a candle, that if he puts his fingers into the
      flame of it, he will be burnt again. He believes this in every case which
      happens to arise; but without looking, in each instance, beyond the
      present case. He is not generalising; he is inferring a particular from
      particulars. In the same way, also, brutes reason. There is little or no
      ground, for attributing to any of the lower animals the use of
      conventional signs, without which general propositions are impossible. But
      those animals profit by experience, and avoid what they have found to
      cause them pain, in the same manner, though not always with the same
      skill, as a human creature. Not only the burnt child, but the burnt dog,
      dreads the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I believe that, in point of fact, when drawing inferences from our
      personal experience, and not from maxims handed down to us by books or
      tradition, we much oftener conclude from particulars to particulars
      directly, than through the intermediate agency of any general proposition.
      We are constantly reasoning from ourselves to other people, or from one
      person to another, without giving ourselves the trouble to erect our
      observations into general maxims of human or external nature. When we
      conclude that some person will, on some given occasion, feel or act so and
      so, we sometimes judge from an enlarged consideration of the manner in
      which men in general, or men of some particular character, are accustomed
      to feel and act; but much oftener from having known the feelings and
      conduct of the same man in some previous instance, or from considering how
      we should feel or act ourselves. It is not only the village matron who,
      when called to a consultation upon the case of a neighbour's child,
      pronounces on the evil and its remedy simply on the recollection and
      authority of what she accounts the similar case of her Lucy. We all, where
      we have no definite maxims to steer by, guide ourselves in the same way;
      and if we have an extensive experience, and retain its impressions
      strongly, we may acquire, in this manner, a very considerable power of
      accurate judgment, which we may be utterly incapable of justifying or of
      communicating to others. Among the higher order of practical intellects,
      there have been many of whom it was remarked how admirably they suited
      their means to their ends, without being able to give any sufficient
      reasons for what they did and applied, or seemed to apply, recondite
      principles which they were wholly unable to state. This is a natural
      consequence of having a mind stored with appropriate particulars, and
      having been long accustomed to reason at once from these to fresh
      particulars, without practising the habit of stating to oneself or to
      others the corresponding general propositions. An old warrior, on a rapid
      glance at the outlines of the ground, is able at once to give the
      necessary orders for a skilful arrangement of his troops; though if he has
      received little theoretical instruction, and has seldom been called upon
      to answer to other people for his conduct, he may never have had in his
      mind a single general theorem respecting the relation between ground and
      array. But his experience of encampments, under circumstances more or less
      similar, has left a number of vivid, unexpressed, ungeneralised analogies
      in his mind, the most appropriate of which, instantly suggesting itself,
      determines him to a judicious arrangement.

      'The skill of an uneducated person in the use of weapons, or of tools, is
      of a precisely similar nature. The savage who executes unerringly the
      exact throw which brings down his game, or his enemy, in the manner most
      suited to his purpose, under the operation of all the conditions
      necessarily involved, the weight and form of the weapon, the direction and
      distance of the object, the action of the wind, &amp;c., owes this power
      to a long series of previous experiments, the results of which he
      certainly never framed into any verbal theorems or rules. It is the same
      in all extraordinary manual dexterity. Not long ago a Scotch manufacturer
      procured from England, at a high rate of wages, a working dyer, famous for
      producing very fine colours, with a view of teaching to his other workmen
      the same skill. The workman came; but his mode of proportioning the
      ingredients, in which lay the secret of the effects he produced, was by
      taking them up in handfuls while the common method was to weigh them. The
      manufacturer sought to make him turn his handling system into an
      equivalent weighing system, that the general principle of his peculiar
      mode of proceeding might be ascertained. This, however, the man found
      himself quite unable to do, and therefore could impart his skill to
      nobody. He had, from the individual cases of his own experience,
      established a connection in his mind between fine effects of colour, and
      tactual perceptions in handling his dyeing materials; and from these
      perceptions he could, in any particular cases, infer the means to be
      employed, and the effect which would be produced, but could not put others
      in possession of the grounds on which he proceeded, from having never
      generalised them in his own mind, or expressed them in language.

      'Almost every one knows Lord Mansfield's advice to a man of practical good
      sense, who, being appointed governor of a colony, had to preside in its
      court of justice, without previous judicial practice or legal education.
      The advice was to give his decision boldly, for it would probably be
      right; but never to venture on assigning reasons, for they would almost
      infallibly be wrong. In cases like this, which are of no uncommon
      occurrence, it would be absurd to suppose that the bad reason was the
      source of the good decision. Lord Mansfield knew that if any reason were
      assigned it would be necessarily an afterthought, the judge being <i>in
      fact</i> guided by impressions from past experience, without the
      circuitous process of framing general principles from them, and that if he
      attempted to frame any such he would assuredly fail. Lord Mansfield,
      however, would not have doubted that a man of equal experience, who had
      also a mind stored with general propositions derived by legitimate
      induction from that experience, would have been greatly preferable as a
      judge, to one, however sagacious, who could not be trusted with the
      explanation and justification of his own judgments. The cases of able men
      performing wonderful things they know not how, are examples of the less
      civilised and most spontaneous form of the operations of superior minds It
      is a <i>defect in them</i>, and <i>often a source of errors</i>, not to
      have generalised as they went on; but generalisation is a help, the most
      important indeed of all helps, yet not an essential.'*

      by a Thames waterman who had a wooden leg. The stranger saw that the
      wooden leg was used to stand in the water with, while the other was high
      and dry. The apparent economy of the fact struck the Chinese; he saw in it
      strong evidence of design, and wrote home that in England one-legged men
      are kept for watermen, to the saving of all injury to health, shoe, and
      stocking, from standing in the river.'*

      Samuel Bailey has furnished, in one passage, both a clear illustration of
      the process, and the validity of an induction:&mdash;'Whoever had
      witnessed the acts of a landlord to his tenants, of a schoolmaster to his
      pupils, of artizans towards their apprentices, of husbands towards their
      wives, on points where the power of the superior could not be contested,
      and where his personal gratification was incompatible with just conduct to
      the subordinate, would necessarily have formed in his own mind a species
      of general rule; and from this rule he might safely draw an inference as
      to what would be the conduct of a despot, seated on a throne, in the
      possession of unchecked authority; assisted too, as the inquirer would be,
      by that <i>indispensable and inestimable guide to the knowledge of
      mankind, an appeal to his own feelings</i>, in a variety of <i>analogous</i>
      instances.

      'We conclude, that a ruler with uncontrolled power will act the tyrant,
      not merely from the fact that Caligula, or Nero, or Bonaparte did, but
      from a thousand facts attesting that men, in, every situation, use
      uncontrolled power in this way&mdash;just as we infer that all bodies tend
      to the centre of the earth, <i>not merely from the circumstance of an
      apple dropping from a tree, but from seeing the tendency in stones, water,
      animals, and all things within our observation</i>. The use of
      uncontrolled power, for the gratification of the possessor, without an
      equitable respect to others, is no more peculiar to monarchs, than a
      tendency to the earth is peculiar to apples. It may be useful to know that
      <i>monarchs</i> act in this way, as it may be useful to know that apples
      drop to the ground; but it is much more useful to know that <i>men</i> act
      in this manner. <i>An inference is safer when gathered from the widest

      It may be useful to observe that, though a few instances are insufficient
      to establish a theory, one may be sufficient to overturn a theory,
      fancifully or hypothetically supported, Gibbon overturns the entertaining
      theory of Rudbeck, an antiquarian of Upsal, of profound learning and easy
      faith, who, by the dim light of legends and traditions, of conjectures and
      etymologies, sought to establish the antiquity of Sweden over half the
      earth. Gibbon annihilated this well laboured system of German antiquities,
      by a single fact too well attested to admit of any doubt, and of too
      decisive a nature to leave room for any reply&mdash;the fact that the
      Germans, of the age of Tacitus, were unacquainted with the use of letters.

      In the chapter on 'Facts' I have cautioned the reader against unquestioned
      data. This seems the place to remark that the unsuspected sources of error
      and unfriendliness have their rise in the criminal implicitness with which
      we listen to reports, and infer from rumours as from facts. These are the
      very little handles which move men and women to strange performances.'*
      All the plots of dramas and romances are founded on misunderstandings,
      which a little sagacity of action (such as a wise resolution not to be
      imposed upon would lead to) would commonly suffice to arrest the error at
      its birth. With regard to character we constantly infer from data,
      partial, limited, and doubtful. If most quarrelers were called into a
      court of Inquiry to confess the real grounds from which they have arrived
      at certain conclusions with regard to their neighbours, and often with
      regard to their friends, they would be at once overwhelmed with a
      conviction of the weakness of which they have been guilty. Upon analysing
      the miserable sources of opinions of which scandal and calumny are born, I
      have found it impossible to restrain astonishment at the imbecility of
      logical power men will sometimes be content to exhibit, where meanness
      prevails, malice incites, and passion governs. Well might Bacon exclaim&mdash;'Doth
      any man doubt, that if there were taken out of men's minds, vain opinions,
      flattering hopes, false valuations, imaginations, and the like, but it
      would leave the minds of a number of men poor shrunken things?'** The wise
      rule is, never judge from appearances when facts can be had&mdash;never
      receive a report without challenging its foundation, nor adopt it without
      permission to give the authority.

      In all cases, in which you must judge from appearances and reason from
      conjectures, adopt the <i>fairest</i> interpretation possible. On this
      principle, credit will sometimes be given where none is due&mdash;but in
      nine cases out of ten, justice will be done, for I am satisfied that there
      is more worth among men than wisdom, and that we do well much oftener than
      we reason well. We seldom need judge charitably, did we always endeavour
      to judge justly. But we make a virtue of our own errors, and we often
      affect to <i>condescend</i> to pronounce an opinion, which it would be
      criminal to withhold. If ever I go to the Herald's, office, the motto I
      will have emblazoned shall be this&mdash;Justice is sufficient. Could we
      only get justice in the world, we could afford to excuse it all its
      'charity' of judgment, and its benevolence even of act.

      Where should a man's reputation be safe from suspicion if not in the hands
      of his friend? It ought to be a principle of action with all men, never to

      To avoid being the cause of misunderstanding to others, it is a good rule
      never to speak critically of others, except in their presence, or in
      print. When I am obliged to do this in conversation, with persons of
      unknown or doubtful exactitude, I take care to keep much below the truth
      in matters of censure, as anything of that kind may gain ten or twenty per
      cent, in carriage. When with men of just habits of interpretation, I pay
      them the highest compliment of friendship, and speak to them of others,

      Notorious are the contumelies put upon the cases of grievance presented

      ascribe to others as crimes what exists only in their own surmises, that
      most popular cases may be stripped of half their pretensions without

      The only mode of correcting this evil is to instil into the people the
      wise rule of Burlamiqui. To reason, (that is, inductively) says this
      writer, is to calculate, and as it were draw up an account, after
      balancing all arguments, in order to see on which side the advantage lies.
      Burlamiqui had law chiefly in view in his remark, but the rule is of
      immense application. A logician is a secretary or banker's clerk, who
      keeps an account between truth and error. When a lady once consulted Dr.
      Johnson on the degree of turpitude to be attached to her son's robbing an
      orchard&mdash;'Madam,' said Johnson, 'it all depends upon the weight of
      the boy. I remember my schoolfellow, Davy Garrick, who was always a little
      fellow, robbing a dozen orchards with impunity, but the very first time I
      climbed up an apple tree, for I was always a heavy boy, the bough broke
      with me, and it was called a judgment. I suppose that is why Justice is
      represented with a pair of scales.' This may not be the precise reason why
      Justice has a pair of scales, but the point goes to the root of the
      matter. Without weighing there can be neither justice nor fair induction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In illustration of these views Mr. Mill has some able remarks:&mdash;'In
      proportion to any person's deficiency of knowledge and mental cultivation,
      is generally his inability to discriminate between his inferences and the
      perceptions on which they were grounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a marvellous tale many a scandalous anecdote, owes its origin to this
      incapacity. The narrater relates, not what he saw or heard, but the
      impression which he derived from what he saw or heard, and of which
      perhaps the greater part consisted of inference, though the whole is
      related not as inference but as matter-of-fact. The difficulty of inducing
      witnesses to restrain, within any moderate limits, the intermixture of
      their inferences with the narrative of their perceptions, is well known to
      experienced cross-examiners; and still more is this the case when ignorant
      persons attempt to describe any natural phenomenon. "The simplest
      narrative," says Dugald Stewart, "of the most illiterate observer involves
      more or less of hypothesis nay, in general, it will be found that, in
      proportion to his ignorance, the greater is the number of conjectural
      principle involved in his statements. A village apothecary (and, if
      possible, in a still greater degree, an experienced nurse) is seldom able
      to describe; the plainest case, without employing a phraseology of which
      every word is a theory; whereas a simple and genuine specification of the
      phenomena which mark a particular disease&mdash;a specification
      unsophisticated by fancy, or by preconceived opinions, may be regarded as
      unequivocal evidence of a mind trained by long and successful study to the
      most difficult of all arts, that of the faithful <i>interpretation</i> of
      nature."'*

      It is in judgments formed, in reprehensible indifference to the actual
      facts of the case, that party rancour and the proverbial injustice of
      popular political opinion take their rise. A useful caution on this head
      is pronounced by Lord Brougham in his sketch of the life of Lord
      Wellesley:&mdash;'How often do we see,' observes his lordship, 'vehement:
      and unceasing; attacks made upon a minister or a statesman, perhaps not in
      the public service, for something which he does not choose to defend or
      explain, resting his claims to the confidence of his countrymen upon his
      past exertions and his known character. Yet these assaults are
      unremittingly made upon him, and the people believe that so much noise
      could not be stirred up without something to authorise it. Sometimes the
      objects of the calumny are silent from disdain; sometimes from knowing
      that the base propagators of it will only return to their slander the more
      eagerly alter their conviction of falsehood; but sometimes, also, the
      silencer may be owing to official reserve, of which we see a most
      remarkable instance in the ease of Lord Wellesly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only are enemies of the people afforded a justification for their
      opposition by wrongful judgment pronounced upon them, but the friends of
      the people often pass over to the other side through the same cause. When
      a leader of the people first comes in personal contact with the opposite
      party, and becomes acquainted with merits of feeling and judgment which he
      had as it were pledged himself to deny, and indeed achieved himself a
      position by disbelieving in, he becomes ashamed of the injustice exacted
      from him by his inexorable adherents, and forsakes his party when he
      should only forsake its errors. The case of Barnave, in the first French
      Revolution, is a memorable instance of this. On lesser theatres I have
      seen many instances of this kind of conversion; Such changes have always
      been ascribed to venality, yet they are men of generous instincts who are
      thus overcome&mdash;but they want logical strength, and cannot correct
      themselves without falling.

    <p>
      It is a wise rule in conversation, never to guess at meanings. When, an
      observation is made, capable of affording two inferences, at once put the
      question which shall elicit the meaning intended. Conversation is held to
      no purpose unless explicitness comes out of it. Innumerable are the errors
      that arise through letting remarks pass, of which we only <i>suppose</i>
      we know the purport. This is a fruitful source of misunderstanding. When
      in Scotland I was much instructed by the intellectual characteristics of
      the people. The Scotch are essentially a reflective people. The English
      conceive doubts, but the Scotch put them into queries. Before I had been
      in the country many hours I was struck by the inductive habits of the
      people. A very old and illiterate woman, to whom I put an indefinite
      question, eyed me deliberately from head to foot before she gave me an
      answer. Not in rudeness did she gaze, so much as in inquiry as to what
      could be my object. I spent more than a week in inquiring at places, where
      apartments were to be let, by which I acquired profitable acquaintance
      with the people. Upon asking the terms of apartments, I was met, in all
      cases, by several preliminary questions, as for whom were they? what
      number of persons? what station, habits, and probable stay? Then I
      received the precise answer required. It did not seem to me that they were
      answering one question by asking another, as is sometimes said of the
      Scotch&mdash;but by a happy and wise presence of mind they asked, as all
      should do, at many questions as were required to complete the data of the
      specific answer they were called upon to give.

      A wise practice is followed in courts of law. No judge pronounces an
      opinion on a hypothetical case. What he would do? or what would be the
      judgment of the law, suppose a certain case should arise?&mdash;are
      questions he never condescends to answer. 'Bring the plaintiff into court,
      let the evidence be taken, and then we will decide. We sit here to judge
      actual, not suppositious cases.' Such would be the reply. People out of
      court might profit by the example.

      I remember one striking instance of the pernicious effects of surmise.
      Some years ago I took part in a Fraternal Demonstration at Highbury Barn.
      The assembly was numerous, and composed of persons of all nations and all
      parties. The celebration was avowedly one of fraternity. The tone of the
      meeting reflected its object. Pacific words were on every tongue, and
      harmony reigned up till eleven o'clock. At that hour Monsieur Chillman
      asked me if some steps could not be taken to annualize the meeting, and he
      requested me to prepare and propose a resolution to that effect. Monsieur
      Chillman, thinking the resolution ought to come from an Englishman,
      strongly urged me to move it. I, thinking it too important to emanate from
      a young man, looked about for a person of experience and known discretion
      to introduce it. After several had declined, Mr. Hetherington undertook
      it. The English politicians were composed of two parties, the friends of
      Mr. O'Connor, and the members of the National Hall. At that time they were
      pleased to be the antipodes of each other. No sooner had Mr. Hetherington
      spoken, he being the friend of Mr. Lovett, than his motion was supposed to
      come from Mr. Lovett's party, though they were utterly ignorant of its
      origination. Clamour's hundred tongues were loosened. Slumbering
      differences were awakened. Suspicion spread like an infection. Fraternity
      perished of the contagion. Twenty amendments were proposed, and it was not
      till midnight, and then in a storm indescribably contradictory of the
      meeting's whole purport, that a common understanding was come to. Had the
      least inquiry been made by the objecting party, previously to dissenting,
      they would have found that the suspicious proposition originated with one
      of themselves. But assuming premises, they inferred from conjecture
      instead of fact, and raised disastrous doubts as to the ability of that
      assembly for domestic or international fraternisation.

    <p>
      The use and abuse of authority Is a subject worthy of the young logician's
      serious attention. Many great writers like Bacon, through policy&mdash;Burke
      through position, or Shakspere through versatility of genius, have written
      on both sides of important questions. Such men, taken piece-meal, may be
      quoted by the most opposite parties in favour of the most opposite
      opinions. Unless there is time to make a broad induction from their
      writings, showing, by weighty, quantitive evidence, the side to which they
      leaned, better not quote them as <i>authorities</i> at all, but give what
      expresses your own views on your own responsibility&mdash;indeed, in <i>all</i>
      cases, the quoter ought to stand prepared, if possible, to justify all he
      cites from another in argument. 'There is perhaps something weak and
      servile in our wishing to rely on, or draw assistance from, ancient
      opinions. Reason ought not, like vanity, to adorn herself with old
      parchments, and the display of a genealogical tree; more dignified in her
      proceedings, she ought to derive everything from herself; she should
      disregard past times, and be, if I may use the phrase, the contemporary of
      all ages.'* Quote others as Grotius did: not as judges from whose decision
      there is no appeal, but as witnesses whose conspiring testimony confirms
      the view taken.

      Analogy has frequently been confounded with induction. Analogy signifies
      reasoning from resemblances subsisting between phenomena&mdash;induction,
      reasoning from the sameness of phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phenomena affording an induction of a law of nature must be obvious,
      uniform, and universal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules to be observed in deducing general principles are, that the case
      be true and the facts universal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this subject, as exhibiting the clearest results arrived at, I
      transcribe a passage from Mill: 'There is no word which is used more
      loosely, or in a greater variety of senses, than analogy. It sometimes
      stands for arguments which may be examples of the most rigid induction.
      Archbishop Whately, for instance, following Ferguson and other writers,
      defines analogy conformably to its primitive acceptation, that which was
      given to it by mathematicians, resemblance of relations. In this sense,
      when a country which has sent out colonies is termed the mother country,
      the expression is analogical, signifying that the colonies of a country
      stand in the same <i>relation</i> to her in which children stand to their
      parents. And if any inference be drawn from this resemblance of relations,
      as, for instance, that the same obedience or affection is due from
      colonies to the mother country which is due from children to a parent,
      this is called reasoning by analogy. Or if it be argued that a nation is
      most beneficially governed by an assembly elected by the people, from the
      admitted fact that other associations for a common purpose, such as joint
      stock companies, are best managed by a committee chosen by the parties
      interested; this, too, is an argument from analogy in the preceding sense,
      because its foundation is, not that a nation is like a joint stock
      company, or Parliament like a board of directors, but that Parliament
      stands in the same <i>relation</i> to the nation in which a board of
      directors stands to a joint stock company. Now, in an argument of this
      nature, there is no inherent inferiority of conclusiveness like other
      arguments from resemblance, it may amount to nothing, or it may be a
      perfect and conclusive induction. The circumstance in which the two cases
      resemble, may be capable of: being shown to be the <i>matereal</i>
      circumstance; to be that on which all the consequences, necessary to be
      taken into account in the particular discussion, depend. In the case in
      question, the resemblance is one of relation; the <i>fundamentum
      relationis</i> being the management, by a few persons, of affairs in which
      a much greater number are interested along with them. Now, some may
      contend that this circumstance which is common to the two cases, and the
      various consequences which follow from it, have the chief share in
      determining all those effects which make up what we term good or bad
      administration. If they can establish this, their argument has the force
      of a rigid induction: if they cannot, they are said to have failed in
      proving the analogy between the two cases, a mode of speech which implies
      that when the analogy can be proved, the argument founded upon it cannot
      be resisted.'*

      'Many of the most splendid and important discoveries in this science were
      the result of analogical reasonings. It was from this source that Dr.
      Priestley proved the compound nature of atmospheric air; and it is related
      that it was in consequence of hints which he had given, when on a visit to
      Paris, to Lavoisier, founded entirely upon analogical conjectures, that
      the latter philosopher was induced to commence experiments, with the view
      of proving the compound nature of water, and of reducing it to its
      constituent elements. Indeed the whole history of this very important and
      useful department of human knowledge exhibits very striking and
      incontestable proofs how much of the art owed its existence to mere hints
      and conjectures, founded, in many cases, upon very slight resemblances or
      analogies.*. The chief province of analogy is confined to that of
      suggestion. Analogies are the great hinters of experiments. They
      illustrate an argument, but do not establish it. They are probabilities,
      not proofs. Hence Lord Brougham in one place exclaims:&mdash;'I have a
      dread, at least a suspicion, of all analogies, and never more than when on
      the slippery heights of an obscure subject; when we are, as it were, <i>inter
      apices</i> of a metaphysical argument, and feeling, perhaps groping, our
      way in the dark, or among the clouds. I then regard analogy as a dangerous
      light, a treacherous <i>ignii fatuus</i>.'**
    </p>
    <p>
      A striking instance of the fallacy of analogy is afforded in the
      experiments of Professor Matteuoci, which seem to prove that though the
      analogies between electricity and nervous substance are nearly perfect,
      yet they are two distinct agencies.***

      CHAPTER XI. DETECTION OF FALLACIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE hope to be able to save students from the fate of Diodorus, (a great
      logician, who died in his school through shame at being, unable to resolve
      a quibble propounded by Stilno)&mdash;not by hardening, but by
      enlightening them. Though we bring neither mood nor figure wherewith to
      test the presence of error, we are not without the hope of qualifying the
      student for its discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been confessed from the throne of logic that, 'After all, in the
      practical detection of each individual fallacy, <i>much must depend on
      natural and acquired acuteness</i>: nor can any rules be given, the mere
      learning of which will enable us to <i>apply</i> them with mechanical
      certainty and readiness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulwer, in remarking that error is a view of <i>some</i> facts instead of
      a survey of <i>all</i>, indicated the key to logical fallacy. Error lies
      principally in defective premises. Sophistry in science is referable to
      incomplete analysis of nature, of systems&mdash;to artificial arrangements&mdash;to
      <i>supposing</i> qualities, to <i>assuming</i> principles, to false
      inductions from imperfect demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dickens, in 'Nicholas Nickleby,' gives the case of a certain lady, who,
      because she knew <i>one</i> young milliner, who retained red cheeks and
      did not die of consumption, was immovably of opinion that all
      representations of the injurious effect of such sedentary occupation were
      false. It is ever so with the vulgar. Some one case has come under their
      notice, and it is in vain that you appeal to a chain of facts. They know
      nothing of induction&mdash;they know one case to the contrary, and that is
      enough. This error is the source of vulgar prejudice. Once teach men that
      truth does not lie in a single instance, but in a calculation in a balance
      of probabilities, and you rationalise them. 'The chapter of accidents [or
      single instances] is the Bible of the fool&mdash;it supplies him with a
      text against everything great, or good, or wise.'*

     Where others toil with philosophic force,
     Their nimble nonsense takes a shorter course,
     Flings at your head convictions in the lump,
     And gains' remote conclusions with a jump.&mdash;Cowper,
</pre>
    <p>
      The first source of error is defective induction. We easily arrive at this
      point of examination by the questions we have proposed for use in the test
      of syllogism. Formerly, one syllogism was required to be defeated by
      another&mdash;we now attack a fallacy by induction. No false syllogism,
      says Biennan, can resist the inductive process of sifting particulars.

     The reason why, I cannot tell&mdash;
     But this I know, and know full well,
     I do not like thee, Dr. Fell.
</pre>
    <p>
      This kind of thing will not do. Induction pursues the reasoner with an
      eternal <i>why</i>. A clear because to a clear why, is a demand that is
      never remitted in sound logic.
    </p>

      Lord Melbourne, in giving his reason for his religion in the House of
      Lords, said it was the religion of his forefathers and that of his
      country, <i>therefore</i>, he would support the church. (Cheers from the
      opposition benches.) The Brahmin and Mussulman give the same reason for
      theirs. A logician in facts would have said, I hold and support my
      religion because it is <i>true</i>. What the standard of physical
      certainty is to facts, what axioms are to science, such is induction to
      syllogisms&mdash;it is the test of their correctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Whately exhibits the following instance of a regularly expressed
      syllogism:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Every dispensation of Providence is beneficial:
  Afflictions are dispensations of Providence,
  Therefore, they are beneficial.
</pre>
    <p>
      Every applicable rule of Dr. Whately's logic is, of course, applied here&mdash;it
      is true in mood and figure, and yet the argument is fallacious. A fallacy
      is defined as 'an ingenious mixture of truth and falsehood, so entangled
      as to be intimately blended&mdash;that the falsehood is, in chemical
      phrase, <i>held in solution</i>: one drop of sound logic is that test
      which immediately disunites them, makes the foreign substance visible, and
      precipitates it to the bottom.'* But whence is to come 'this drop of sound
      logic?' Not from the Doctor's <i>Elements,</i> they have sent forth the
      fallacy. But touch it with the talisman of facts and; the error will
      appear.

    <p>
      What facts support the assertion that Afflictions are dispensations of
      Providence?' The simple question is fatal to the argument. Can such a
      proposition have facts for its support? Ignorance, congregating in narrow
      courts, and laziness, accumulating filth, generate sickness and
      affliction. Are these the dispensations of Providence, or the
      dispensations of folly and crime? To ascribe them to Providence is
      virtually to allow ignorance and laziness to step into the throne of God,
      and call upon men to believe in <i>their</i> beneficent dispensations. Dr.
      Watts, another writer on logic, set the Christian congregations of England
      to sing the same species of fallacy:&mdash;-

      According to this lyrical logician, whenever wise precautions arrest the
      progress of pestilence, or the physician's skill subdues disease, Jehovah
      is robbed of a servant. By such an argument, humanity is made to be in
      rebellion against heaven, and our medical colleges are in antagonism with
      Deity, and the recent appointment, by the Russell government, of a
      Sanatory Commission, was high blasphemy. It is the degradation of language
      to employ it to such a purpose, and logic needs revising to save us from
      publishing such puerility in the name of learning and of reason. It must
      have been logic of this kind that induced a strong-thoughted woman to
      hazard the bold but tenable conjecture, that 'If an argument has truth in
      it, less than a philosopher will see it&mdash;and if it has not, less than
      a logician will refute it.'*

      It was the boast of Archimedes, that if any one would find him a fulcrum,
      on which to rest a prop, he would raise the world, But this was mere
      assertion unsupported by facts, for if the fulcrum had been found him,
      Archimedes could not have performed his promise. This has been proved by
      Ferguson, who has demonstrated that if Archimedes could have moved with
      the swiftness of a cannon ball&mdash;480 miles every hour&mdash;it would
      have taken him just 44,963,540,000,000 of years to have-raised the world
      one inch. Bulwer remarks, 'Critics have said, what a fine idea of
      Archimedes! But how much finer is the fact that refutes it. <i>One of the
      sublimest things in the world is plain truth</i>.'

      Innumerable sophisms are suffered to pass in consequence of Some

      says, 'Helvetius erred upon education&mdash;but his dogma has been
      beneficial.' Probably so&mdash;but not so beneficial as the truth would
      have been. Many persons have argued from such an instance, that error is
      useful. Dickens, in those incidental observations of striking good sense
      strewed up and down his writings, says, in the 'Cricket on the Hearth:'&mdash;'These
      remarks (of Mrs. Fielding) were quite unanswerable: which is the happy
      property of all remarks that are <i>sufficiently wide of the purpose</i>.'

      CHAPTER XII. SCEPTICISM
    </h2>
    <p>
      Man has been called the plaything of chance, but there is no logic more
      close and inflexible than that of human life: all is entwined together;
      and for him who is able to disentangle the premises and patiently await
      the conclusion it is the most correct of syllogisms.&mdash;Jules Sandau:
      People's Journal, No. 87.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To quote authors,' says Harris, in his preface to his Hermes,' 'who have
      lived in various ages, and in distant countries; some in the full maturity
      of Grecian and Roman literature; some in its declension; and others in
      periods still more barbarous and depraved; may afford, perhaps, no
      unpleasing speculation, to see how the same reason has at all times
      prevailed; how there is one truth like one sun, that has enlightened human
      intelligence through every age, and saved it from the darkness both of
      sophistry and error.' This is the assurance which right reason will ever
      impart. Underneath all the change after which we pant, amid all the
      variety which surrounds us, and seem the very aliment of our nature, lies
      the instinct after the permanent. It is the province of sound logic to
      guarantee this in conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The novelty, change, fluctuation, which scientific discovery has brought,
      and will yet bring, into the formerly settled worlds of opinion and social
      condition, will unsettle men's minds, and pave the way to an age of
      scepticism. Sound logic is necessary to provide that this doubt is
      transitional and not ultimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scepticism is of two kinds, that of Pyrrho, and that of examination. The
      followers of Pyrrho, it is said, made doubting a profession, until at last
      they doubted whether they did doubt. This is the scepticism of the scorner
      and trifler.

      He did not know that he did not know it, and if he did know it it was more
      than he knew. This is as far as the philosopher, of this school can go.
      Dickens has drawn the portrait of these, logicians in Mr. Tigg:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'When a man like Slyme,' said Mr. Tigg, 'is detained for such a thing as a
      bill' I reject the superstition of ages, and believe nothing. I don't even
      believe that I don't believe, curse me if I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Hood is ironical on the professors of uncertainty. 'On a certain day of a
      certain year, certain officers went, on certain information, to a certain
      court, in a certain city, to take up a certain Italian for a certain
      crime. What gross fools are they who say there is nothing certain in this
      world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But scepticism is not capable of disturbing the well-grounded repose of
      the wise; for when the sceptic thinks he has involved everything in doubt,
      everything is still left in as much certainty as his scepticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great maze of conflicting opinion, it matters little that we are
      cautioned that reason is not all-sufficient&mdash;it is the best
      sufficiency we have. If reason will not serve us well, will anything serve
      us better? Bishop Berkeley may demonstrate that we are not sure of
      matter's existence&mdash;but are we more sure of any thing else? We are
      not thus to be cajoled. But it is right to say that Mr. J. S. Mill
      contends that Berkeley has been misunderstood&mdash;but if he did argue,
      as popularly believed, to such argument, the answer of Byron is sufficient&mdash;

      delusion of things appears to our understandings or affects our fortunes.

      The 'wise considerate scepticism' of inquiry has been well expressed by
      Emerson, in his recent lecture on Montaigne.&mdash;'Who shall forbid a
      wise scepticism, seeing that there is no practical question on which
      anything more than a proximate solution is to be had? Marriage itself is
      an open question: those "out" wish to be "in:" those "in" to be "out."
    </p>
    <p>
      The state. With all its obvious advantages, nobody loves it. Is it;
      otherwise with the Church? Shall the young man enter trade or a profession
      without being vitiated? Shall he stay on shore or put out to sea? There is
      much to be said on both sides. Then there is competition and the
      attractions of the co-operative system. The labourer has a poor hut, is
      without knowledge, virtue, civilisation. If: we say, "Let us have
      culture," the expression awakens a new indisposition; for culture destroys
      spontaneous and hearty unencumbered action. Let us have a robust manly
      life; let us have to do with realities, not with shadowy ghosts. Now this
      precisely is the right ground of the sceptic; not of unbelief, denying or
      doubting&mdash;least of all of scoffing and profligate jeering at what is
      stable and good. He is <i>the considerer</i>. He has, too many enemies
      around him to wish to be his own. The position of the sceptic is one taken
      up for defence; as we build a house not too high or too low; under the
      wind, but out of the dust. For him the Spartan vigour is too-austere. St.
      John too thin and aerial. The wise sceptic avoids to be fooled by any
      extreme; he wishes to, see the game. He wishes to see all things, but
      mainly men. Really our life in this world not of so easy interpretation as
      preachers and school-books are accustomed to describe it.' These have not
      so efficiently solved the problem, that the sceptic should yield himself
      contentedly to their interpretation. True, he does not wish to speak
      harshly of what is best in us,&mdash;to turn himself into a "devil's
      attorney." But he points out the room there is for doubt;&mdash;the power
      of moods;&mdash;the power of complexion, and so forth. Shall we, then,
      because good-nature inclines us to virtue's side, smoothly cry: "There are
      no doubts!"&mdash;and lie for the right? We ask whether life is to be led
      in a brave or a cowardly way: whether the satisfaction of our doubts be
      not essential to all manliness: whether the name of virtue is to be a
      barrier to that which is virtue? The sceptic wants truth, wants to have
      things made plain to him, and has a right to be convinced in his own way.
      In such scepticism there is no malignity; it is honest, and does not
      hinder his being convinced; and this hard-headed man, once convinced will
      prove a giant in defence of his faith. The true and final answer in which
      all scepticism is lost is the moral sentiment: that never forfeits the
      supremacy. It is the drop that balances the universe.'

      Science and logic have so far advanced as to abridge the field of doubtful
      questions. When syllogism answered syllogism, uncertainty reigned absolute&mdash;but
      now that the appeal is to facts, we can, wherever facts can be had, weigh
      or number them, and decide on one side or the other.

      When Ali Pacha was at Janina, the case of a poor woman, who accused a man
      of the theft of all her property, was brought before him; but the
      plaintiff having no witnesses, the case was discharged, as the other
      asserted his innocence, and insisted as a proof, that he had not a
      farthing in the world. On their leaving his presence, Ali ordered both to
      be weighed, and then released them without further notice. A fortnight
      afterwards, he commanded both into his presence, and again weighed them;
      the accuser had lost as much as the defendant had gained in weight. The
      thing spoke for itself, and Ali decided that the accusation was just. Ali
      Pacha was the Burlamiqui of justice. Induction, too, has its scales, and
      seldom leaves us in doubt when it gets truth and falsehood in them.
      Scepticism is now happily restricted to those questions resting on
      conjectures, and which do not pertain to the practical affairs of this
      life. On matter-of-fact questions, only the weak are perplexed. After men
      have been in deliberation till the time of action approach, if it be not
      then manifest what is best to be done, it is a sign the difference of
      motives the one way and the other is not great; therefore, not to resolve
      then is to lose the occasion by weighing of trifles, which is
      pusillanimity.

      Quaint old Bunyan tells us, that when he had completed his 'Pilgrim's

      John was not to be thus confounded. 'Then I will print it,' said he, 'and

      the result of some law; is an effect of causes, and could have been
      predicted from a knowledge of the existence of those causes, and from
      their laws. If I turn up a particular card, that is a consequence of its
      place in the pack. Its place in the pack was a consequence of the manner
      in which the cards were shuffled, or of the order in which they were
      played in the last game; which, again, were the effects of prior causes.

      In the great world of opinion it is the duty of honest reasoners to
      endeavour to find out the truth, and take sides, undeterred by the
      philosophical frivolity now growing fashionable. If men are silent
      concerning objects and principles, it is said they have none, and it is
      impatiently asked 'where is their bond of union?' And no sooner is it
      explained than they are told 'it is very unphilosophical to think of
      setting up a creed.' Where the alternatives are thus put against them they
      should take their own course. Creeds are the necessary exponents of
      conviction. The creedless philosopher is out on the sea of opinion,
      without compass or chart. To bind yourself for the future to present
      opinions is doubtless unwise, but he who has inquired to any purpose has
      come to some conclusion, affirmative, negative, or neutral; and it is the
      province of a creed to avow the actual result, and the consequent; conduct
      intended to be followed. It is the vice of free thinking that it spreads
      universal uncertainty, and assumes right and wrong to be so protean that
      no man can tell one hour what opinion he shall hold the next. Logic should
      correct this unsatisfactory extreme, and extirpate the tiresome race whom

      CHAPTER XIII. INTELLECTUAL DARING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Freedom has been hunted through the world, and is ever exposed to Insult
      and injury. It is crushed by conquest; frowned from courts; expelled from
      colleges; scorned out of society; flogged in schools; and anathematised in
      churches. Mind is her last asylum; and if freedom quail there, what
      becomes of the hope of the world, or the worth of human nature?&mdash;W.
      J. Fox's Lectures to the Working Classes, part 12, p. 65.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should be prepared to dare all things for truth. If the 'very hopes of
      man, the thoughts of his heart, the religion of nations, the manners and
      morals of mankind, are all at the mercy of a new generalisation,' we
      should be prepared to risk them. If we must choose between truth and
      repose, we ought not to hesitate. There is danger in having the truth&mdash;philosophers
      are obliged to conceal it. Mankind vaunt their love of truth, but they are
      not to be trusted. From interest or ignorance they always persecute, and
      often kill, the discoverer. Still the pursuit of truth is a <i>duty</i>,
      and we must find consolation in the heroic reflection of Burke, that <i>in
      all exertions of duty there it something to be hazarded</i>. But
      intellectual daring will never be common while it is so generally believed
      to be criminal. We will, therefore, quote some considerations touching the
      rightfulness of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without inquiry it is impossible for us to know whether our opinions are
      true or false, and various are the pretences employed for declining
      investigation: frequently they are masked under vague and metaphorical
      phrases: "inquiry implies the weighing of evidence, and might lead to
      doubt and perplexity"&mdash;"to search into a subject might shake the
      settled convictions of the understanding"&mdash;to examine opposite
      arguments, and contradictory opinions, might contaminate the mind with
      false views.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Every one who alleges pretexts like these for declining inquiry, must
      obviously begin by assuming that his own opinions are unerringly in the
      right. Nothing could justify a man for declining the investigation of a
      subject involving important opinions, but the possession of an
      understanding free from liability of error. Not gifted with infallibility,
      in what way, except by diligent inquiry, can he obtain any assurance that
      he is not pursuing a course of injurious action? If he holds any opinion,
      he must have acquired it either by examination, by instillation, rote, or
      some other process. On the supposition that he has acquired it by proper
      examination, the duty on which I am now insisting has been discharged, and
      the matter is at an end&mdash;but if he has acquired it in any other
      manner, the mere plea, that his mind might become unsettled, can be no
      argument against the duty of investigation. For anything he can allege to
      the contrary, his present opinions are wrong&mdash;and, in that case, the
      disturbance of his blind convictions, instead of being an evil, is an
      essential step towards arriving at the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It may possibly be assigned, as a further reason for his declining
      inquiry, that he may come to some fallacy which he cannot surmount,
      although convinced of its character. If he is convinced of its character,
      he must either have grounds for that conviction or not. If he has grounds,
      let him examine them, draw them out, try if they are valid, and then the
      fallacy will stand exposed. If he has no grounds for suspecting a fallacy,
      what an irrational conclusion he confesses himself to have arrived at! But
      perhaps he will reply&mdash;he may be unable to solve the difficulty; his
      mind may become perplexed, and the issue may prove, after all, that it
      would have been much better had he remained in his former strong, though
      unenlightened, conviction. Why better? If he is in perplexity let him
      read, think, consult the learned and the wise, and in the end he will
      probably reach a definite opinion on one side or the other. But if he
      should still remain in doubt, where is the harm? or rather, why is it not
      to be considered a good? The subject is evidently one which admits strong
      probabilities on opposite sides. Doubt is therefore the proper sentiment
      for the occasion&mdash;it is the result of the best exercise of the
      faculties&mdash;and either positively to believe, or positively to
      disbelieve, would imply an erroneous appreciation of evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the minds of some people a strong prejudice appears to exist against
      that state of the understanding which is termed doubt. A little
      reflection, however, will convince any one that on certain subjects
      "doubt" is as appropriate a state of the reasoning faculties as belief or
      disbelief on others. There are doctrines, propositions, facts, supported
      and opposed by every degree of evidence, and amongst them by that degree
      of evidence of which the proper effect is to leave the understanding in an
      equipoise between two conclusions. In these cages "doubt" is the
      appropriate result, which there can be no reason to shrink from or lament.
      But it may be further urged, that inquiry might contaminate the
      understanding with false views&mdash;and, therefore, It is wise and
      laudable to abstain from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We can comprehend what is meant by contaminating a man's habits or
      disposition, or even imagination. But there is no analogy on these points
      in reference to the understanding. There is contamination, there is evil,
      in preposterous and obscene images crowding before the intellectual
      vision, notwithstanding a full and distinct perception of their character&mdash;but
      there is no contamination, no evil, in a thousand false arguments coming
      before the understanding, if their quality is clearly discerned. The only
      possible evil in this case is mistaking false for true&mdash;but the man
      who shrinks from investigation lest he should mistake false for true, can
      have no reason for supposing himself free from that delusion in his actual
      opinions. Besides these objections to inquiry, there are other prejudices
      of a similar character, forming serious impediments to the attainment of
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One of these is a <i>fear that we may search too far, and become
      chargeable with presumption in prying into things we ought not to know</i>.
      A few words will suffice to prove that nothing can be more irrational and
      absurd. We have already shown that true opinions are conducive to the
      welfare of mankind&mdash;and the prosecution of inquiry is therefore a
      process from which we have everything to hope and nothing to fear, and to
      which there are no limits but such as the nature of our own faculties pre
      scribes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A second prejudice&mdash;that <i>we may contract guilt, if, in the course
      of our researches, we miss the right conclusion, and had therefore better
      let inquiry alone</i>&mdash;is still more influential in preventing those
      investigations which it is our duty to make. As our opinions on any
      subject are not voluntary acts, but involuntary effects, in whatever
      conclusions our researches terminate they can involve us in no
      culpability. All that we have to take care of is, to bestow on every
      subject an adequate and impartial attention. Having done this, we have
      discharged our duty; and it would be irrational and unmanly to entertain
      any apprehension for the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In fact, there is the grossest inconsistency in the prejudice now under
      consideration. If we may contract guilt by searching after truth, wo may
      equally do so by remaining in our present state The reason alleged in the
      prejudice itself, and the only reason which can be assigned with any
      plausibility, why we may commit an offence by embarking in any inquiry, is
      that we may, by so doing, miss the right conclusion, or, in other words,
      fall into error&mdash;for no one would seriously contend that we incur any
      moral culpability by an investigation which conducts us to the truth. But
      it is obvious that we may equally miss the right conclusion by remaining
      in our actual opinions. It is, then, incumbent on us to ascertain whether
      we are committing an offence by remaining in them&mdash;in other words, it
      is necessary to examine whether those opinions are true. Thus the reasons
      assigned for not inquiring, lead to the conclusion that it is necessary to
      inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The third prejudice is that acquiescence in received opinions, or
      forbearing to think for ourselves, shows a degree of humility highly
      proper and commendable&mdash;if closely examined will be found usually to
      evince nothing but a great degree of indolent presumption, or intellectual
      cowardice. There is often, in truth, as great a measure of presumption in
      this species of acquiescence as in the boldest hypothesis which human
      invention can start. That received and established opinions are true, is
      one of those sweeping conclusions which would require very strong reasons,
      and often elaborate research, to justify. On what grounds are they
      considered to be true by one who declines investigation? Because (on the
      most favourable supposition) they have been handed down to us by our
      predecessors, and have been held with unhesitating faith by a multitude of
      illustrious men. But what comprehensive reasons are these? What
      investigation would it require to shew that they were valid? As the whole
      history of mankind teems with instances of the transmission of the
      grossest errors from one generation to another, and of their having been
      countenanced by the concurrence of the most eminent of our race&mdash;how,
      without examination, can we show that this particular instance is an
      exception from the general lot?
    </p>
    <p>
      'From the necessity of using our own judgment, or, in other words, of
      arriving at a conclusion for ourselves, we cannot be absolved. Far from
      being a virtue, blind acquiescence in the opinions of others is, in most
      cases, a positive vice, tending to stop all advancement in knowledge, and
      all improvement in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the preceding it is evident that the inquirer may enter on his task
      with full confidence that he is embarking in no criminal, or forbidden, or
      presumptuous enterprise, but is, on the contrary, engaging in the
      discharge of a duty. Let him be as circumspect as he pleases in collecting
      his facts and deducing his conclusions, cautious in the process, but
      fearless in the result. Let him be fully aware of his liability to error,
      of the thousand sources of illusions, of the limited powers of the
      individual, of the paramount importance of truth&mdash;but let him dismiss
      all apprehensions of the issue of an investigation conducted with due
      application of mind and rectitude of purpose.'*

</pre>
    <p>
      Marcus Antoninus, indeed, said 'I seek after truth, by which no man yet
      was ever injured.' But there is a great practical mistake here. There is
      danger in truth&mdash;-and the admission should be plainly made. Men,
      where forewarned, make the choice more manfully. We have been wisely told
      by Emerson, that the cherished thoughts and institutions of mankind are at
      the mercy of a new generalisation&mdash;rest, commodity, reputation.
      Inconvenience, and suspense, are the consequences of the partizanship of
      truth. Certain political truths annihilate the interests of whole classes.
      Certain social truths war with life-cherished prejudices. Certain sanitary
      truths reduce the value of all city property. Certain scientific truths
      ruin the working classes by thousands. In a wiser state of society this
      could be prevented, but our present business is with what is. It is
      therefore idle to conceal the truth&mdash;that there is danger in truth.
      Pope's dictum, that party is the madness of many for the gain of a few, is
      inversely true of truth. Truth is the ultimate benefit of many, but the
      immediate ruin of the few. Here, however, comes to our aid the wise and
      far-seeing aphorism of Burke&mdash;'In all exertions of duty there is
      something to be hazarded'&mdash;and the brave man and wise friend of
      mankind will risk the fate which surely awaits him&mdash;the fate of
      Galileo, Newton, Salomon de Caus, Volta, Fulton, Winser, Arkwright, Gall,
      and all who present themselves, with truth in their hands, at the door of
      this great bedlam called the world&mdash;the fate of being received with
      stones and hisses.

      CHAPTER XIV. IDOLS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The term Idol is employed by Bacon to designate those prejudices which men
      prefer to truth. A prejudice is a bias without a reason for it, an opinion
      without a foundation, a judgment formed of persons and things without
      sufficient examination, an assent given to a proposition without
      sufficient evidence. The bias may be honourable, the opinion correct, the
      assent in the right direction, but still of the nature of prejudice,
      because, if right, it is right by accident rather than design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignorance hides from us facts, and we decide partially rather than confess
      our deficiency. Ill-directed education gives us pre-possessions, which are
      obstacles in the way of truth, and we continue to cherish what, having
      become a part of our nature, it pains us to discard. The senses will
      occasionally mislead us and although we are conscious that appearances are
      not to be wholly trusted, we reluctantly doubt our own infallibility. From
      early, and therefore unquestioned, associations, we have acquired certain
      habits, and from fashion certain sentiments, and we continue old customs,
      and fall into the current opinion unconsciously. Of these sources of
      prejudice, logic warns us to beware. Of so much importance did Bacon
      regard these hindrances to truth, that he considered the pursuit of new
      truth hopeless while they were cherished. In a mixed vein of poetry and
      philosophy, he divided prejudices into four classes, which he called Idols
      of the Tribe, the Den, the Market and the Theatre. Idols of the Tribe are
      prejudices men imbibe from early training, and love of hypothesis. They
      are so called because common to the whole race or tribe of mankind. Idols
      of the Den are those which relate to a man's particular character, Idols
      of the Market are those which are accommodated to common notions. Idols of
      the Theatre denote such as pertain to hypothetical systems of philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembering the declarations of Euler and Gall, and the daily discoveries
      of science, we should stand, as it were, on the verge of the old world of
      experience, and look out on the new world of troth. A young thinker should
      make for himself a chart of proposed reforms, systems, and changes,
      agitated in his day&mdash;place
    </p>
    <p>
      In relative positions in the scale of importance such as he deems of
      value, if true&mdash;and then analyse his experience to see what is
      soundly opposed thereto. Such a practice would go far to rid men of
      idol-prejudices, which retard private improvement and public progress.

      The student will find the proof of this proposition exhibited in the
      example of Induction, quoted from Mr. Bailey, p. 63.

    <p>
      2. Prosperity could never be reached and maintained in this country,
      without some provision for the regular employment of the poor.&mdash;Mr.
      Beckett's Speech in the House of Commons, Feb. 3,1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      The demonstration, to universal conviction, of this proposition, would
      lead to an entire and beneficial change of the social condition of this
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The pen is the tongue of the world.&mdash;Paine. Put this in the
      syllogistic form.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. A good instance of a metaphorical argument drawn out is given by Mr.
      Mill:&mdash;'For instance, when Mr. Carlyle, rebuking the Byronic vein,
      says that "strength does not manifest itself in spasms, but in stout
      bearing of burdens;" the metaphor proves nothing, it is no argument, only
      an allusion to an argument; in no other way however could so much of
      argument be so completely suggested in so few words. The expression
      suggests a whole train of reasoning, which it would take many sentences to
      write out at length. As thus: Motions which are violent but brief, which
      lead to no end, and are not under the control of the will, are, in the
      physical body, more incident to a weak than to a strong constitution. If
      this be owing to a cause which equally operates in what relates to the
      mind, the same conclusion will told there likewise. But such is really the
      fact. For the body's liability to these sudden and uncontrollable motions
      arises from irritability, that is, unusual susceptibility of being moved
      out of its ordinary course by transient influences: which may equally be
      said of the mind. And this susceptibility, whether of mind or body, must
      arise from a weakness of the forces which maintain and carry on the
      ordinary action of the system. All this is conveyed in one short sentence.
      And since the causes are alike in the body and in the mind, the analogy is
      a just one, and the maxim holds of the one as much as of the other.'*

      5. A youth, named Evathlus, engaged with Protagoras to learn dialectics,
      and promised his tutor a large sum of money, <i>in case he gained the
      first cause he pleaded</i>, Evathlus, when fully instructed, refused to
      pay his instructor. Protagoras brought his action thus&mdash;'You must pay
      the money however the cause go, for if I gain you must pay in consequence
      of the sentence, as being cast in the cause; and if you gain it, you must
      pay in pursuance of our covenant.' 'Nay,' Evathlus retorts, 'which way
      soever the cause be decided, you will have nothing, for if I prevail, the
      sentence gives it that nothing is due: and if I lose, then there is
      nothing due by the covenant.' What should be the decision in this case?
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The first case, says Cervantes, requiring Sancho's attention was a
      question put by a stranger, in presence of the stewards and rest of the
      attendants. 'My Lord,' said he, 'a certain manor is divided by a large
      river. I beg your honour will be attentive, for the case is of great
      consequence and of some difficulty. I say then, upon this river is a
      bridge, and at one end of it the gibbet, together with a sort of court
      hall, in which four judges usually sit to execute the law enacted by the
      lord of the river, bridge, and manor, which runs to this effect: Whoever
      shall pass this bridge, must first swear whence he comes and whither he
      goes; if he swear the truth he shall be allowed to pass, but if he
      forswear himself he shall die upon the gallows without mercy or respite.
      This law, together with the rigorous penalty, being known, numbers passed,
      and as it appeared they swore nothing but the truth, the judges permitted
      them to pass freely and without control. It happened, however, that one
      man's oath being taken, he affirmed and swore by his deposition that he
      was going to be hanged on that gibbet, and had no other errand or
      intention. The judges, having considered this oath, observed: if we allow
      this man to pass freely, he swore to a lie, and, therefore, ought to be
      hanged according to law; and if we ordered him to be hanged after he hath
      sworn he was going to be suspended on that gibbet, he will have sworn the
      truth, and by the same law he ought to be acquitted, I beg, therefore, to
      know, my lord governor [and student], what the judges must do with this
      man?'

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
