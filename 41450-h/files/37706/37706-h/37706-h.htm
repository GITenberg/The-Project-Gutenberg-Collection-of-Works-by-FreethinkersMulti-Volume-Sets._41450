    <h2>
      THE HOLY COAT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We believe that the best way to introduce our subject is to quote some few
      passages from the authorized document published at Treves, with special
      reference to the ceremonial which took place in that Cathedral, giving an
      account of the history of the Holy Goat, and explaining and defending the
      step which the Church was about to take in the matter. The following are a
      few extracts:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirty-four years have now elapsed since our city found within its walls
      200,000 strangers, all actuated by a pious longing after this holy relic,
      before which they might present their adoration, and, in lively feelings
      of devotion, strengthen themselves in the faith and the love of the Lord.
      The order which prevailed during the whole ceremony, though nightly
      between twenty and thirty thousand persons were quartered in the city&mdash;the
      universal devotion and edification manifested by the pilgrims&mdash;still
      live in the recollection of all those who witnessed the ceremony from its
      beginning to its close. * * Meanwhile, since this period, the youth of our
      city have grown to ripe manhood; and, accordingly, they have expressed the
      wish that the venerable relic should be once more exhibited. These pious
      wishes could not remain unknown to our worthy Bishop, who, indeed, had
      previously resolved to meet them. Before his consecration in 1842, when he
      met Prince Metternich in Coblentz&mdash;who is, from reasons known only to
      few, in possession of one of the holy nails, and who then promised to
      restore that which was the rightful property of the Cathedral of Treves&mdash;the
      Bishop had determined to signalize the event of the restoration of the
      Holy Nail, by exhibiting both the Nail and the Coat to the religious
      worship of the people. But the promised return of the nail has not yet
      taken place, although the confidence placed on the promise of the Prince
      still allows us to cherish this hope. Notwithstanding, as this could not
      be the case, in the present year, the Bishop resolved to satisfy the
      general desire expressed for the exhibition of the holy coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      From the historical inquiry it appears, according to the author, that this
      said relic was brought by Helena, the mother of Constantine, from the Holy
      Land, in the fourth century, and deposited in the Cathedral of Treves,
      which was then the residence of the emperors, and the most famous city in
      the empire, after Rome itself. It lay in concealment till the 9th century.
      To Frederick I. is attributed the honour of reviving the attention of the
      Church and people to the great treasure of their cathedral and city. After
      being again 300 years concealed, Maximilian I., to give pomp and
      distinction to a <i>diet</i> held in the city, caused it to be exposed to
      the adoration of the inhabitants. In the three following centuries, (16th,
      17th, and 18th,) the occasion of its exhibition was the holding of the
      German Diet, when the city was filled with princes and princesses, as well
      as crowds of devout pilgrims. In the period of the French Revolution, it
      fared ill with the holy coat. It was, according as danger threatened,
      carried to the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein. On the new political
      organization of the Rhine provinces, it was made the subject of earnest
      diplomatic transactions between Nassau, France, and Bavaria&mdash;the last
      Elector of Treves, and the Bishop, Carl Maunay; and the Church of Treves
      has to thank its Bishop&mdash;whose requests Napoleon did not generally
      refuse&mdash;for the recovery of much of their possessions, and for the
      restoration of this relic, the most valuable of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      After being concealed for centuries, the first public representation took
      place in 1196. In 1514, Leo X. issued a bull, proclaiming <i>complete
      absolution of sin to all who, in the proper spirit, made a pilgrimage to
      Treves, and contributed to the expenses of the spectacle</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a great deal about the history of the coat with its various
      exhibitions, and a defence of the worship of relics, the Address closes as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The believing sight of this pre-eminently sacred relic, with which stand
      connected, in a manner so immediate and impressive, the associations with
      the whole life and sufferings of the Saviour, must at once cause many
      overpowering thoughts and feelings to be awakened in the soul, so that one
      must feel himself involuntarily torn asunder by them, and believe that he
      is placed in the immediate presence of the body of our Lord. * * In all
      these lively associations, the Christian believes that he hears the voice
      of Him who wore this raiment, proclaiming the words of eternal truth, and
      exhorting sinners to repentance; he believes the holy garment encompassed
      with that brilliancy of light which on Mount Tabor made Peter exclaim, 'It
      is good to be here;' he believes that it is covered with that sweat which
      bedewed his face on the Mount of Olives. Hence the phenomenon that often
      hardhearted men were led, by the sight of the holy coat, and the feelings
      of devotion thereby awakened, to turn into themselves; their heart has
      melted like ice before the heat of the sun, and thus have they been
      brought back to God and his means of grace in the Church. O! may many such
      miracles take place in these days, which are now approaching. May God
      bless the resolutions of the faithful, who come on a pilgrimage to our
      venerable cathedral, guide their steps on the road to the august
      sanctuary, and infuse devotion and love into their souls!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the spirit of the authorized document, issued under the auspices
      of the ecclesiastical authorities at Treves; and it may well be
      questioned, whether, in the most gloomy periods of Catholic superstition,
      anything has appeared which savoured more of all that is degrading and
      blasphemous in the system. On the 6th of July 1844, the general
      announcement of what was to take place was made, with the regulations to
      be observed by the different processions of pilgrims. After stating their
      joy at the proposed spectacle, the chief announcement is made as follows:&mdash;"This
      holy relic will accordingly be exhibited for a period of six weeks,
      beginning with the 18th August, in order to satisfy the desires of those
      who may have the pious intention of proceeding to Treves, to worship the
      holy garment of our divine Saviour by immediate view, each of whom will,
      according to the bull of Pope Leo X., dated 26th January 1514, receive <i>complete
      absolution</i>. * * Accordingly, we intimate to all within the bishopric,
      what we believe to be called for, that there should not be a too numerous
      streaming together of the faithful on the same day, causing disorder and
      confusion; and also that no neighbourhood may be deprived to too great an
      extent of its inhabitants. Accordingly, it is required that two separate
      days be allocated for each part of the bishopric, so as to divide the
      number of those who intend to come to Treves; and also that the localities
      for particular days be so arranged as to prevent the crowding together of
      too many pilgrims on the same line of road." Then follow fourteen
      regulations to carry out these views, the whole signed by the
      Vicar-General.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long-looked for day at length arrived. The whole country was in
      commotion, and from many hundred places at once the pilgrimages began.
      Every possible arrangement had been made by the authorities of Treves for
      the reception of, and maintenance of order among the vast and motley
      assemblage that streamed hither and thither, to take part in the
      ceremonial. It was a period when devotion was worked up into a wild
      enthusiasm, and all for the time, whatever their age, or sex, or land, or
      character might be, were hurried along by the same frenzied zeal, and felt
      the ordinary differences of life and society to vanish before the august
      ceremony that for the time had assimilated all classes of the faithful. On
      the morning of the 18th August, all the bells in the churches were made to
      announce that the ceremony had actually begun. The steamers on the Moselle
      were crowded with passengers, who disembarked amid the discharge of
      cannon. All kinds of vehicles, in addition to the regular
      post-conveyances, were called into requisition, and the romantic
      appearance and interest of the whole was enlivened and enhanced by the
      motley groups of pilgrims, in all varieties of costume, who had made the
      journey on foot. Pontifical High Mass was performed by Dr. William
      Arnoldi. An oration by Dr. Braun followed, bearing upon the great event of
      the day. Then came the elevation and exhibition of the holy relic; and at
      ten o'clock the procession of the pilgrims commenced. Gens-d'armes were
      stationed without, the clergy of the cathedral within,&mdash;whilst, in
      the immediate neighbourhood of the relic, was a guard of honour, composed
      of the most respectable of the citizens, and recognised by their silk
      sashes over the shoulder, in the yellow and red colours of the city.
      Benches were placed from the portal on the right side of the cathedral, to
      the choir, and between these the procession moved. Each of the pilgrims
      was allowed to stand a short time before the relic, yet so vast was the
      concourse, that between one and two thousand are reported to have passed
      in the short space of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relic itself was placed near the altar in a gold frame, with a glass
      front at a considerable distance from it; its shape resembling a French
      blouse,&mdash;the colour somewhat brown&mdash;though the poor peasantry
      were taught to believe that to every eye it presented a combination of
      colours entirely distinct. An opening was made on each side of the frame,
      to allow the hand to come in contact with the relic; and whatever did
      touch it, was believed to acquire a peculiar sanctity. A deep basin was
      placed in front, to receive the offerings of the pilgrims, which were to
      be given to the Cathedrals at Treves and Cologne, and to a Catholic
      seminary in the former city.
    </p>
    <p>
      No certificate of creed was required, so that the crowds of Protestants,
      who were drawn from mere curiosity, had the fullest opportunity of seeing
      what was to be seen. The ceremony continued daily, during the whole six
      weeks, for twelve hours, and was opened and closed by the chime of the
      cathedral bells. At the commencement the weather was fine, but in a few
      days it became quite unsettled and stormy; yet nothing could damp the
      long-cherished ardour of the pilgrims. Band after band advanced, and, like
      the crusaders of old, all the sufferings and hardships of the journey were
      forgotten as they approached the Holy City. The fatigues of long
      travelling were so far relieved by addresses from the clergy who marched
      with their parishioners, and still more by the sacred music which, ever
      and anon, filled the air. Vast bodies of clergy, from distant parts,
      arrived to take part in the ceremonial with the general body of the
      faithful, and, afterwards, share in the heavy duties of the Mass and the
      Confessional, as required for such an extraordinary occasion. At last, to
      complete the arrangements, on the evening of the 23d, an immense banner,
      with a red cross on a white ground, was elevated to the top of the
      cathedral, to direct the weary steps of the pilgrims, and to cheer their
      hearts as they approached the august city. So vast occasionally was the
      concourse, that on some days not fewer than about 20,000 were quartered
      within the walls. Fortunately such arrangements had been made with regard
      to the supplies of provisions, that but a small rise of price in the
      necessaries of life was perceptible, which is certainly remarkable, when
      it is stated that in one week, at least 150,000 strangers visited the
      city, and in the whole time about 1,200,000. Truth also requires the
      remark&mdash;that, taken as a whole, matters were conducted with general
      decorum and regularity, though it requires but little knowledge of human
      nature to see that where there was such a miscellaneous concourse of
      people, often ill fed and ill lodged, the ordinary regulations and
      observances of society would be disregarded, and a strong encouragement
      and temptation be given to immorality and crime. Although it was
      officially stated that there was accommodation in the city and
      neighbourhood for 20,000 persons, still all the powers of military police,
      and clergy combined, could not prevent many mournful scenes of misery and
      vice. It is, by the way, a most significant fact that, along with the
      announcement now mentioned there was added, under equally official
      authority, the urgent request that "<i>all citizens and strangers should
      avoid all criticism on religious matters or opinions</i>." If anything
      were required to convince one that the high authorities of Treves were
      afraid of the effects of free discussion, or even doubtful allusion to
      what might well make the most bigoted inquisitive, this significant
      sentence is sufficient. Such were the scenes which, with every variety of
      incident, were being enacted at Treves&mdash;a melancholy exhibition of
      priestly power to give currency and strength to superstition and blind
      idolatry, as well as of the state of passive submission on the part of the
      people, to all that the Church, in the arrogance of its blasphemies, may
      command. The voice of politics was, for a time, hushed&mdash;the busy
      commerce of the city, and even the harvest labours of the field were
      silent&mdash;everything like this world's occupations and concerns were
      all alike neglected, to give pomp and emphasis to the sad spectacle of
      men's faith deceived and led astray by a piece of an old garment. Not
      merely from the poor villages in the vicinity, but from the enlightened
      towns on the Rhine, from Coblentz, and Bonn, and Cologne, the processions
      of pilgrims came. Take one specimen:&mdash;On the evening of the 22d
      September, a most numerous procession, which had left Cologne nine days
      before for Treves, returned. This procession was composed chiefly of the
      lowest classes, with a vast proportion of women of every age. A body of
      white-dressed girls had advanced a long way to meet the procession,
      bearing all kinds of church emblems in their hands&mdash;crucifixes,
      flowers, anchors, hearts, &amp;c. The pilgrims were all supplied with
      medals and engravings of the Holy Coat, as well as with small books
      containing an account of its history and miracles. These were people who
      looked poor and miserable, and who evidently had not the means to
      undertake such a journey, and yet, such was the passion for visiting
      Treves, that the pawnbrokers reaped a rich harvest from the desperate
      attempts made to collect money enough to supply their bare wants during
      their absence from home, and to give their votive offerings to be applied
      as before mentioned. Cases the most heart-rending have been published of
      poor people parting with their last possessions to obtain means for the
      journey, from which they looked for such marvellous results. The sick even
      were carried thither, with the firm belief that they would be healed; and
      the debased devotion of the pilgrims broke out in such expressions&mdash;"Holy
      Coat, we pray to thee. Holy Coat, pray for us," and the like. The higher
      classes, of course, consulted their own convenience in their modes of
      travelling, employing the Rhine and Moselle steamers or their private
      conveyances; but it is melancholy to think, that such vast bodies of the
      respectable classes did lend their influence to these unholy exhibitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But without entering into farther details let us hasten to the closing
      scene on the 7th October. At 2 p.m. the doors of the Cathedral were
      closed, and the ceremony of removing the holy relic from public view
      proceeded with in presence of the whole body of the clergy. At four the
      doors were re-opened, and Bishop Arnoldi delivered a discourse, to a vast
      audience, on the "<i>Unity of the Church.</i>" At its close, began the
      procession of the civil officials, of teachers of all grades, of merchants
      and artisans, and of the guard of honour, dressed in black, with wax
      torches, through the transept into the choir, to join in the <i>Te Deum</i>.
      After the hymn of St. Ambrose had been sung, accompanied by the thunder of
      the cannon and the pealing of all the bells in the city and neighbourhood,
      the general procession advanced through the chief streets of the city. The
      committee were in front, followed by the guard of honour; they were
      succeeded by the different fraternities, all with wax candles&mdash;a
      strong choir of singers, then vast crowds of the people, with the various
      trades, each with their peculiar flags and emblems. They proceeded through
      the chief parts of the city to the palace of the Bishop, which was
      brilliantly illuminated. He, accompanied by the head Bishop of Verdun and
      the dignitaries of the Cathedral, dispensed the benediction. Then advanced
      from the arch-diocese of Cologne a torch-procession, accompanied by
      instrumental music. The whole proceedings were closed by the chorus,&mdash;"Lord
      God! we praise thee," in the Cathedral. The chief streets of the city were
      illuminated in the evening, and the grand organ continued pealing. In the
      middle window of the Cathedral where, in former times, the exhibition of
      the relic had taken place, was a transparency of the Cross, with splendid
      emblematic devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      While all this was going on within the Cathedral, outside there was
      everything to call the mind of the devotee from the scene in which he had
      taken part; for, in addition to the jostling and bustle of the crowded
      city, there was everything in the way of the ordinary and extraordinary
      sights of a fair, to make him forget the feelings and object of his
      pilgrimage. Menageries, panoramas, plays, &amp;c, all solicited the
      attention and money of those assembled, equally with the music and
      services of the Cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishops who had officiated during the ceremonial from first to last,
      were those of Metz, Nancy, Verdun, Luxembourg, Spires, Limburg, Osnabrück,
      Münster, Cologne, with several from Holland. Each bishop entered the city
      amid the ringing of the church bells. The pilgrims from France did not
      enter the city in processional order, but their clergy were numerously
      represented. During the whole period, processions to the city were not
      uncommon. Controversies between several of the journals, as to many
      occurrences connected with the proceedings, have taken place. Charges have
      been advanced, and as flatly contradicted, so that we do not feel called
      on to detail either the nature of the charges or the defence. It is easy
      enough admitting exaggeration on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only remains to notice the inseparable adjuncts of such proceedings&mdash;the
      <i>miracles</i> which are said to have been effected. To a Protestant, who
      has not spent some time in a Catholic country, it must seem in the highest
      degree strange to hear of solemn statements, by opposite newspapers in
      support of, or in opposition to, certain pretended miracles; nay, not only
      so, but to have counter-medical certificates pitted against each other on
      the issue. Yet all this has lately been done. It would be worse than
      useless to recite the floating stories which one hears in the
      neighbourhood, about Protestant clergymen dying suddenly in the full
      possession of health, for having denounced the whole thing as a piece of
      imposture to a body of passing pilgrims, or of the many miraculous cures
      of sight, lameness, and the like. Yet, that all this is fact, any
      intelligent and inquiring tourist of the Rhine can testify. One case, in
      particular, created great interest, that of the Countess
      Droste-Vischering, a relation of the Archbishop of Cologne, who has been
      for many years unable to walk without the use of crutches, but who, after
      beholding the Holy Coat, was enabled, to the wonderment of all, to walk
      home unassisted. The plain truth comes out from her medical adviser,&mdash;that
      she had been long suffering from a diseased knee-joint, that she resolved
      at all hazards to go to Treves, and that, while in a fit of ecstasy before
      the relic, she had excited a degree of energy, in stretching or bending
      the diseased limb, which had given the temporary relief, by relaxing the
      long rigid muscles. Since this period she has had relapses, and is, we
      believe, now using the crutches, which had been too hastily hung up in the
      Cathedral as a thank-offering for her marvellous restoration. Yet this
      simple story is paraded about and magnified into a miracle, to give still
      greater <i>éclat</i> to the Holy Coat and the church ceremonies connected
      with it. It would be useless to enter into other details, when all are
      equally barefaced. The above case may be selected as a rather better than
      average specimen of the popish miracles of the continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, in finishing this part of the subject, we may be allowed to quote
      the opinion of one of the great organs of German Catholicism:&mdash;"Who
      can deny that this exhibition of the Holy Coat has been an event for the
      Rhine provinces and the West of Europe, which, in its consequences, must
      be of the greatest moment, whilst, for its grandeur, in church history it
      is unprecedented? Proceeding from a small circle, it has already embraced
      a wide circumference in its influence." After enumerating the quarters
      from which the crowds of pilgrims flocked, he proceeds:&mdash;"Who shall
      name those, principally from the higher classes, who came as single
      pilgrims from distant cities and lands, and what language do all these
      bands speak? They proclaim the triumph of faith over a system of false
      enlightenment; the victory of the newly-awakened elements of the day over
      all overthrowing tendencies&mdash;in a word, they proclaim the power of
      the Church, which has brought together such vast bodies of men, separated
      among so many princes by language and habits, yet made to act as the
      members of one and the same body."
    </p>
    <p>
      We now turn to the more pleasing part of the subject, the statement of the
      more striking particulars connected with the late re-action against this
      God-dishonouring spectacle. It was impossible that a movement so singular
      and extensive should escape being made the subject of general newspaper
      remark and criticism. And, as the fact has proved, it has been argued and
      re-argued in a hundred ways by Catholic and Protestant journals, so that
      the whole bearings of the case, and the positions of all the different
      political and religious parties in the country in relation to it, have
      been brought and kept steadily before the public mind. This, it is clear,
      can be but seldom realized where the State puts its <i>imprimatur</i> upon
      the full freedom of the press, and where, in consequence, <i>public
      opinion</i> is but struggling for existence and definite expression,
      instead of being, as in Britain, the one element which overrules and
      directs the movements of the whole social system. <i>We</i> can appreciate
      the effects of <i>free inquiry</i>;&mdash;and when we know that this is
      now being unsparingly applied to the workings of that system, which "loves
      the darkness rather than the light," we may, under God's guidance and
      blessing, be allowed to look for new and large results, in the way of the
      exposure of errors, which have the sanction of long centuries of
      ignorance, and of great preparatory movements at least, for the reception
      of the truth as it is in Jesus. This is one great point gained; and if the
      spirit of inquiry, which has now been excited, could be but well directed,
      we might already rejoice in the Protestant prospects of Germany. That men
      feel unsatisfied with <i>what is</i>, is manifest&mdash;that feelings long
      kept under, are now obtaining clear and full expression&mdash;that men are
      being undeceived in having so long believed a lie, and often in agony of
      spirit are seeking for the simple truth to bring peace to their souls&mdash;all
      this, and much more is evident, and calls loudly for our active sympathies
      and prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few points call for especial notice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Very many of the <i>Catholic</i> journals have taken their stand against
      the late scenes at Treves. It is true, that several of those Journals may
      have been actuated by secondary motives in so doing, or what is the
      notorious fact, that some, at least of such Journals, want almost entirely
      a religious character; and though Catholic in name, are infidel in fact.
      Still it is equally notorious, that several of the Catholic Journals,
      whose orthodoxy is above suspicion, have lifted up their voice against
      what has taken place, as scandalous to Christianity, and eminently
      perilous to the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the discussions which have appeared in the public prints, a
      vast mass of pamphlets has been issued on both sides. The most remarkable
      of these is, one issued by two professors in Bonn, <i>Gildermeister and
      Sybel</i> (the latter a Catholic,) entering into a grave and learned
      historical inquiry as to the genuineness of the relic, exposing in the
      most triumphant manner the various defences which have appeared on the
      Catholic side,&mdash;and all characterized by the most severe sarcasm, in
      holding up the trumpery of the system of relic-worship to contempt. The
      title of the book is "<i>The Holy Coat of Treves, and the twenty other
      Holy Coats</i>." A second edition was soon called for, in which four other
      such relics were stated as discovered. It is generally known, that among
      these numerous claimants for genuineness, the great body of the French
      clergy have bid hard to prove that the Coat of Argenteuil is the genuine
      one; and this view has been warmly defended by one of the Catholic clergy
      of Einsiedeln in Switzerland&mdash;notoriously one of the most celebrated
      places of pilgrimage in the world. More than this, writings have appeared
      stating the events connected with the other relics of the same name, and
      treasured with equal sanctity in numerous Cathedrals; also giving an
      account of the separate and independent series of miracles wrought by each
      as the true Coat of the Lord. It would be tedious to detain the reader
      with more of such details. We desire merely to notice the various workings
      of the movement in and out of the Catholic Church. It may accordingly
      suffice to state in addition, that poetry as well as prose has been called
      into requisition, and that satirical ballads and lyrics have been
      numerously circulated, and eagerly read by all parties. Many of them are
      filled with the most stinging remarks on the general position and moral
      character of the clergy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by far the most important element in the movement, and, in fact, that
      which has determined its subsequent direction, has been the following
      letter of John Ronge, priest in Silesia, dated Laurahütte, 1st October
      1844, and entitled, "Opinion of the Catholic Priest John Ronge, on the
      Holy Coat of Treves:"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laurahütte, October 1st.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opinion of a Catholic Priest in regard to the Holy Tunic at Treves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christians of the nineteenth century,&mdash;you have heard&mdash;you know
      it&mdash;men of Germany&mdash;you know it&mdash;spiritual and temporal
      teachers of the German people, that what would once upon a time have
      sounded in our ears as a fable or a fiction&mdash;is neither a fiction nor
      a fable, but real truth and verity. Bishop Arnoldi of Treves has exhibited
      for the adoration and reverence of Christians, a garment called the Tunic
      of our Lord!
    </p>
    <p>
      "According to the last account, five hundred thousand persons have already
      made a pilgrimage to see this relic, and every day fresh thousands flock
      to it, especially since the garment in question is found capable of curing
      diseases and working miracles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The news has spread among the people of all lands, while certain priests
      in France maintain that they alone possess the real tunic of Christ, and
      that the one at Treves is an imposture. Truly the saying here applies,&mdash;'He
      who can occupy his mind about such things without losing his reason, has
      none to lose.' Five hundred thousand men&mdash;five hundred thousand
      intelligent Germans have&mdash;already hastened to see or to adore a piece
      of dress at Treves! The greater number of these thousands are from the
      lower orders of the people, and, besides, in deepest poverty,&mdash;oppressed,
      uneducated, stupid, superstitious, and in part demoralized. They leave the
      cultivation of their fields, the labour of their workshops, the care of
      their households, the education of their children, to take part in a
      Heathen festival at Treves&mdash;a disgraceful spectacle, which the Romish
      Church displays before their eyes. Yes, it is a Heathen festival, for many
      thousands of the credulous multitude to render to a piece of dress,&mdash;the
      work of human hands,&mdash;that regard and adoration which are due to God
      alone. And what pernicious consequences must follow from these
      pilgrimages! Thousands of the pilgrims deprive themselves of the
      necessaries of life to raise the money for their journey, and the offering
      which they make to the Holy Tunic&mdash;that is, to the clergy. They
      purchase it by sacrifices of their comfort, or by begging&mdash;only to
      starve on their return; to suffer want, or to fall sick in consequence of
      the fatigues of the journey. If these external results are sufficiently
      melancholy, the moral consequences are far more so. Will not many of them,
      reduced to want by the expenses of their journey, endeavour to relieve
      themselves by unlawful means?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many wives and virgins sacrifice their purity of heart, their reputation,
      and their chastity, destroying thus the peace, the happiness, and comfort
      of their families.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fine, this most unchristian exhibition but creates an inlet for
      superstition, hypocrisy, and fanaticism, with all the vice that follows in
      their train. Such is the blessing spread abroad by the exhibition of the
      Holy Tunic, and it is a matter but of small moment whether it be genuine
      or false.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the man who publicly displays this piece of dress&mdash;the work of
      human hands&mdash;for reverent regard&mdash;who leads astray the religious
      feelings of the credulous, ignorant, or suffering people&mdash;giving
      thereby an impulse to vice and superstition&mdash;who wrings their
      substance from the poor and starving multitude&mdash;who entails on
      Germany the ridicule of other lands, and who draws more close together the
      heavy clouds which float already dark and dismally above our heads&mdash;this
      man is a bishop, a German bishop. It is Arnoldi, Bishop of Treves!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arnoldi, Bishop of Treves, I therefore turn to you, and demand, by
      authority of my office and calling as a priest and teacher of the German
      people&mdash;in the name of Christendom, in the name of the German nation,
      and in the name of its instructors&mdash;that you put an end to the
      unchristian spectacle of the exhibition of the Holy Tunic&mdash;and
      withdraw this garment, that the offence which it has given may not be
      still increased! For, do you not know&mdash;as bishop you ought to know&mdash;that
      the Founder of the Christian religion left to his disciples and his
      followers not his coat but his spirit?&mdash;his coat, Bishop Arnoldi of
      Treves, belongs to his <i>executioners!</i> Do you not know&mdash;as
      bishop you ought to know&mdash;that Jesus taught&mdash;'God is a Spirit,
      and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth?' and He
      may be worshipped everywhere, not only in the temple at Jerusalem, on the
      Mount Gerizim, or at Treves, in presence of the holy tunic; do you not
      know&mdash;as bishop you ought to know&mdash;that the Gospel expressly
      forbids the adoration of every image and of every relic? that Christians
      in the Apostolic age, and in the three first centuries, suffered neither
      images nor relics in their churches (and <i>they</i> might have had plenty
      of them)? that the worship of images and relics is a Heathen custom, and
      that the Fathers in the first three centuries abused the Heathens on
      account of it? We read, for instance, (Div. inst. 11., c. 2,) 'Neither do
      these besotted men understand that if the images possessed life and
      motion, they would rather worship the man by whom they had been formed.'
      Lastly, do you not know&mdash;as bishop you ought to know this also&mdash;that
      the vigorous and healthy mind of the German people was first degraded to
      the worship of relics by the Crusades in the 13th and 14th centuries? when
      the exalted conception of the Godhead which Christianity inculcates, had
      been obscured by all the lying marvels brought from eastern lands? Hark
      ye! Bishop Arnoldi of Treves, you know all this, and better probably than
      I can tell it to you. You also know the effects which superstition and the
      idolatrous adoration of relics have worked among us, namely, the religious
      and political bondage of Germany; and yet, you can display your relics to
      the admiration of the multitude. And were it even possible you should be
      ignorant of all that I have told you,&mdash;that the salvation of souls
      was your sole aim in the exhibition of this Holy Tunic,&mdash;you would,
      notwithstanding, have two sins upon your conscience. In the first place,
      it is unpardonable, if the garment in question actually possess saving
      power, that you have withhold its benefits from suffering men until the
      present time. And, secondly, it is unpardonable that you accept the
      offerings of these countless multitudes. And is it not unpardonable that
      you, as bishop, should accept of money from our poor and starving people,
      especially when you have seen, not many weeks ago, that hundreds have been
      driven by necessity to mutiny, despair, and death? Do not allow yourself
      to be deceived by the influx of thousands upon thousands, but, believe me,
      that while hundreds of thousands of the German people hasten with holy
      fervour (?) to Treves, <i>millions</i>, like myself, are filled with
      horror and the deepest indignation by the disgraceful spectacle. And this
      indignation prevails not in individual ranks and parties, but among all
      classes&mdash;even in the Catholic priesthood. Judgment will overtake you,
      therefore, sooner than you think. Arnoldi! the historian is already
      seizing his pen, to submit your name to the contempt of your
      contemporaries and of posterity, and stigmatizes you as the Tetzel of the
      nineteenth century!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, fellow-citizens of Germany, whether near or at a distance from
      Treves, unite your efforts to prevent the continuance of such an insult to
      the German name. You have various means of working, take courage and
      employ them; endeavour each and all, with resolute determination, to
      encounter and restrain the tyrannous despotism of the Romish Church. For
      it is not in Treves alone that the modern traffic in indulgences is
      carried on; you are aware that in the east and west, the north and south,
      rosary, mass, indulgence, burial moneys, and the like, are still
      increasing, and with them spiritual darkness. Forward, then! Catholics and
      Protestants, together to the work! Our happiness, our honour, our freedom
      are at stake. Do not the manes of your fathers, who stormed the Capitol,
      frown to see you suffer patiently the Castle of St. Angelo to lord it over
      Germany. Dishonour not the laurels of a Huss, a Hütten, and a Luther. Give
      words to their ideas, and convert their will into deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Finally, my colleagues, whose sole endeavours and desires are centred in
      the welfare of your congregations, the honour, the freedom, and the
      happiness of your German countrymen, keep no longer silence! You sin
      against your reputation, your religion, and your fatherland, if you longer
      hesitate to follow out your improved convictions. I have already,
      elsewhere, briefly addressed you, and shall therefore now conclude. Prove
      yourselves the true disciples of Him who gave up all for truth, and light,
      and liberty. Show that you have inherited, not his garment, but his
      spirit.

      "Johannes Ronge, <i>Catholic Priest</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be at once seen that this letter is the production of no ordinary
      man; and, at a glance, it cannot but remind us of him "whose words were
      half battles." Few living Germans have such mastery over their language in
      all its native strength. It was just such a production,&mdash;short,
      nervous, and earnest,&mdash;that was required to give utterance to the
      slumbering thoughts and sympathies of thousands. Appearing in a distant
      and comparatively unknown part of Germany, it soon found its way wherever
      the German language was spoken, and, wherever it has found its way, there
      it has called forth a deep and hearty response. It has now been translated
      into various languages, and, despite all the preventive measures of police
      and clergy, it may now be found by the thousand all over Germany. It is
      not our present purpose to state in what points the views of the author
      seem defective. Our immediate object is simply to lay before the reader
      some facts illustrative of the anti-Catholic movement which has taken
      place, and is now advancing steadily. But first a word about the course
      pursued with regard to the author. From events which had previously taken
      place in the Cathedral of Breslau, to which diocese he was attached, the
      suspicions of the ecclesiastical authorities were not long in fixing upon
      Ronge as the author of the above letter, which appeared anonymously in the
      <i>Sächsische Vaterlands-blätter</i>. His manly love of truth disdained
      equivocation or subterfuge, and, as the result of all, he was deposed and
      excommunicated. A complete host of pamphlets were called suddenly into
      existence by the daring letter of one who, calling himself a Catholic
      priest, had still the hardihood to asperse the character and cause of the
      one all-holy Church, by attacking one of its most imposing rites, and
      treating with scorn and shame one of its consecrated bishops. Every
      possible charge, affecting his character as a student, as a clergyman, as
      a teacher, and as a man, was raked up against him. Those who had not a
      tithe of his power of fierce and indignant invective, when truth called
      for the vindication of its claims, made up for the defect by personal
      scurrility and the most vulgar abuse. His former associates in the
      priesthood openly denounced him, to exculpate themselves from any supposed
      sympathy with the sentiments or with the man. A friend generously
      undertook his defence&mdash;who declares, that at the Catholic seminary he
      was distinguished by great diligence in his studies, as well as by the
      purity of his moral life; so much so, that the superintendents stated that
      they had seldom under their care a young man who sought to become
      acquainted with the truths of the Catholic faith with such a deep and holy
      earnestness. After a slight sketch of his doings in Breslau and Grottkau,
      he states, "that every friend of his must feel persuaded that the above
      letter proceeded from his inmost convictions. He is utterly incapable of
      falsehood, in word or deed; and, as regards moral character, that he is,
      perhaps, too stringent towards himself, but mild and considerate to
      others. It was only the public wild proceedings of the ultra-Montanists
      and Jesuits that filled him with holy indignation."

      Ronge himself soon felt and saw the importance of the step which he had
      taken. He was now beyond the pale of the Catholic Church, obliged to
      relinquish all in defence of the truth, and exposed, from all quarters, to
      attacks which his conscience told him to be groundless. The cause of
      truth, for which he had already suffered, again demanded that his voice
      should be upraised; and this he does in the following <i>Justification</i>,
      which cannot but interest the reader as the autobiography of a remarkable
      man, but especially from the fearful disclosures which it makes of the
      present state and actual workings of Romanism. All the facts adduced with
      regard to his anguish of mind&mdash;his deep sense of the spiritual
      bondage under which he lay&mdash;his inward and outward struggles&mdash;his
      determined opposition to what he believed to be wrong and unjust&mdash;his
      plain but triumphant vindication of his conduct throughout&mdash;all give
      a character of <i>truthfulness</i> to the document, which is its best
      guarantee, and makes it emphatically <i>speak for itself</i>. It may
      enhance the interest of the following document to know that it was soon
      prohibited by the censor of the press, notwithstanding that the press of
      Leipsic is one of the freest in Germany:&mdash;

      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the following pages are submitted to the unbiassed judgment and
      consideration of my fellow-citizens and the Christian public, the various
      documents connected with my deposition and excommunication. It is not
      therein my aim to vindicate my conduct in the eyes of the <i>so-called</i>
      national teachers, or priests, or of the <i>so-called</i> Catholic
      Christians who are notoriously hypocrites, and who only follow religion
      for a livelihood, or as a means of attaining power and eminence: to
      attempt my vindication before such as these would be degrading to myself
      and to the nation. I desire a verdict of acquittal from those alone, who
      either have, or long to have, religion dwelling in their souls, and who
      are earnestly striving after light and truth, Christian love, and moral
      freedom. All such will acknowledge that I have fought a good fight, and
      not for myself alone; they will grant me their confidence, that we may
      devote our united strength to the accomplishment of that great and
      desirable end, to the achievement of which we are called, as well by our
      holy profession, and our sense of duty, as by our care for the moral and
      temporal well-being of existing and of future generations. The Author.

    <h2>
      CHILDHOOD, SCHOOL DAYS, AND COLLEGE LIFE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was born on the 16th October 1813, in Bischofswald, a village in the
      circle of Neisse, and near the Giant Mountains. I was the third child of
      my parents, who had ten others, of whom two died young. We were set to
      work at an early age, and while my elder brother was employed in the
      cultivation of the farm, my father's little flock of sheep was placed
      under my care and keeping, as the second surviving member of the family.
      Such was my chief occupation between the ages of six and twelve, during
      spring, summer, and autumn, the winter being spent in the performance of
      other species of rural labour. My father was serious, fearless, of sound
      judgment, and devoid of superstition. He died in March 1842. My mother was
      entirely devoted to the care of her family. She died in October 1831. My
      earliest instruction was obtained in the village school of Bischofswald,
      where the only branches taught, even in the highest class, were reading,
      writing, arithmetic, and the learning by rote of the Catechism and Bible
      history. It was only during my last year at school that I was instructed
      in geography and the history of Silesia. In my lonely shepherd life my
      mind dwelt often on religious subjects (I studied my Catechism and Bible
      history for the most part when in the field with my flock) on the future
      life, on time and the eternity beyond; and from such thoughts it acquired
      at times a melancholy tone. One of my teachers persuaded my father to send
      me to the High School, which, owing to his numerous family, he would not
      otherwise have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1827, I entered the High School at Neisse, and left it in 1836. I had
      but little taste for foreign languages, and could not form a friendship
      for Horace or the other Romans; but, on the other hand, I delighted in
      history and German literature. Rotteck enchanted me. It was with
      inexpressible joy that I entered the University of Breslau. I felt and
      knew that I was free, and would indeed have been ashamed to waste my time
      and freedom in idleness and sloth. Associated with a company of
      noble-minded youths, it was our earnest endeavour to cultivate our minds,*
      and strengthen our bodies.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * After a somewhat different fashion, perchance, than that
     prescribed by Rome.
</pre>
    <p>
      I chose theology as my profession, because I felt a strong leaning towards
      teaching, for the gratification of which the holy calling appeared to me
      peculiarly suited. I somewhat feared its formalism, but was not then
      acquainted, as I now am, with the compulsory and hypocritical system of
      the Romish hierarchy. Although several of my friends endeavoured to
      dissuade me from the choice, I fancied myself possessed of such strength
      of character as would enable me not only to meet the danger, but to turn
      it to account. My father, who made me so ample an allowance, that beyond a
      small bursary, I needed no further assistance, left me free to choose. As
      I perceived, however, that his means of providing for my brothers and
      sisters were straitened by his liberality to me, and feeling desirous,
      also, not to diminish their fortune, I deemed it my duty to relieve my
      father, as soon as possible, from the sacrifice which I knew he made on my
      account. This was an external reason, and one, I do not blush to own, for
      determining to enter the Roman Catholic priesthood. And how many of the
      clergy are there who can say, that in their choice of a profession, they
      have not been influenced by similar motives? While I was at the University
      I also fulfilled my period of military service at Breslau, in the corps of
      sharpshooters, under Major von Firk.

    <h2>
      THE SEMINARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the month of December 1839, I was received into the Seminary, and
      entered on a period of mournful and painful conflict. The confidence I had
      hitherto reposed in our spiritual teachers was soon expelled from my
      breast by a nearer survey of their mode of life, and replaced by the
      deepest horror and loathing, which seized me when I became aware how
      shamefully they abused religion, for the purpose of degrading and
      subjecting the people to their will; when I saw by what a fearful veil of
      hypocrisy deceitful Rome surrounds us from our cradles to our graves; when
      I saw how the holiest ordinances are insultingly misused, to crush the
      dignity of human nature. The disgraceful fetters galled me, which, till
      now, I had not felt, and I perceived what many of my fellow sufferers
      endured, and all the more severely, the less they dared <i>avow</i> the
      causes of their suffering. For the policy of Rome knows how to entwine in
      bonds from which there is no escape, all Christians who profess its creed,
      and more skilfully than Moses, who once drew water from the barren rock,
      can conjure money from the impoverished people; but their principal care
      and most consummate skill are constantly directed towards their servants,
      that is to say, to the inferior clergy and <i>their</i> education. The
      inferior clergy are so securely bound in spiritual and external fetters,
      that for the greater number it is almost impossible to escape. The
      peculiar and appropriate armoury for these degrading bonds is the College
      or Seminary for priests. It is there that the youth, who wishes to devote
      himself to the teaching of the people, has the brand of slavery stamped
      deep and painfully upon him; it is there that he is condemned to holy
      idleness; it is there that his spirit is fettered, and bowed to blind
      obedience by superstitious dread and sacred statutes; it is there that he
      is inoculated in heart and soul with hypocrisy and selfish egotism; it is
      there that man is degraded to the condition of a slave, and becomes a
      passive tool. The pain, the torment of this sacrifice is fearful, and
      nature instinctively revolts when she is robbed of her holiest rights, of
      the most valued gifts of the Creator. And yet the slave is silent, and all
      the more so, as the grave is deeper where his freedom and his dignity lie
      buried. It is but seldom that a despairing cry escapes from his inmost
      soul, and dies away in utterance, amid the empty sounds of simulated
      prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot think, without a trembling in my every nerve, on all the ignominy
      which was heaped upon us, and on the disgraceful treatment which we <i>must</i>
      endure; and I could wish the pen I write with were a blazing torch, to
      illuminate the deep abyss wherein hearts are stifled, and spirits
      overwhelmed amid hymns of praise! I need, however, only to depict in
      quiet, softer colours, what I have seen and felt, to rouse with certainty
      the wrathful horror, and the deepest sympathy of the greater part of my
      fellow citizens, who may still be unacquainted with the fearful strategy
      of the Church of Rome.

    <h2>
      THE EARLIER PERIOD OF MY STAY IN THE SEMINARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the first few days after entering the seminary, I saw depicted in
      the countenances of my companions in misfortune, consternation, or
      timidity, the deepest grief, or a sort of desperate resignation, according
      to their several dispositions; the first evening, for example, of six
      acquaintances and friends, who were consigned to the same cell, none
      uttered a single word&mdash;all the six were so amazed, that they strove
      to forget their speechless misery in sleep. Forty young men, in the bloom
      and strength of manhood, glided silently about like mummies. We looked on
      one another in gloomy, speechless sorrow, and each one sought in the
      countenance of his friend, to ascertain the state of feeling in his heart.
      We all endeavoured to attain that heroism, which can resolve at once to
      sacrifice the heavenly dreams of youth, its hopes, its wishes, and its
      freedom,&mdash;in order, as they told us, that we might the more
      successfully promote the temporal and eternal well-being of our
      fellow-men;&mdash;as if it were possible for <i>him</i> to raise men to
      independence and to self-respect, who cannot boast of their existence in
      his own bosom. That, however, which most excited my indignation and
      horror, was the ghastly stagnation, which seen from one side exhibited
      depression,&mdash;from the other, levity, discontent, or cowardice. The
      young man of four and twenty had closed accounts with himself and all
      mankind, the dearest ties were broken which bound him to his fellow-men.
      The glowing and joyful fire of youth, which seeks to achieve for itself a
      bright futurity, was extinguished; and egotism poured the freezing poison
      of suspicion, envy, and self-interest, into the warm and youthful veins.
      We felt as if we were all enveloped for eternity in one impenetrable
      shroud, and as if doleful spirits were singing to us burial songs
      throughout the gloomy night. The despotism of the Roman hierarchy glared
      at me like an awful monster&mdash;a monster which digs graves for the
      burial of living youth&mdash;graves which engulf the freedom and the
      happiness of nations. The young man who wishes to become a teacher of the
      people, must witness his open and upright manliness ruined; he must
      blindly obey, and submit himself to the most degrading oppression, for the
      <i>first</i> injunction laid on him is <i>unconditional obedience</i>. He
      sees that the arrangements and decrees of the hierarchy are contrived for
      the degradation, not the improvement of his country, and that he himself,
      as the servant of a foreign power, is expected to assist in the oppression
      of the land which gave him birth. He is also doomed to bear the weight of
      infamy which accompanies every state of slavery, and the disgrace which
      now attaches to the entire priesthood, from the immorality of many among
      them, whose celibacy is a false profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can glittering coin, wrung from starving poverty and pious fanaticism, or
      wines and dainty viands, make amends? Yes, if he prefer the life of a
      gluttonous animal to that of a man. What <i>can</i> sustain him? The hope
      alone that he may one day aid in breaking the chains which, bind his
      native country! That thought it was which animated <i>me</i>, and kept me
      upright under the pressure of my fearful servitude. But must not the
      nature and the disposition suffer from the depression, and will the moral
      vigour take no scathe? Ah! What if one were to give way to the pressure&mdash;to
      settle down into a hypocrite&mdash;to become an object of contempt to
      one's self and the rest of mankind. All these doubts and apprehensions
      forced themselves <i>even at the first</i> before my mind, and filled my
      spirit with ineffable sadness,&mdash;and they were and are justified&mdash;but
      too well justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the time was skilfully divided between attendance at ceremonies, and
      the repetition of lip-prayers, for from five to six hours daily (including
      the breviary prayers.*) Five hours of prayer daily, and such prayer! for
      young men of twenty-four years, designed to be the salt of the earth! Rome
      uses devotion as a means of enslaving men. I tried by every means to
      escape from the debasing feeling, from the reproach of conscience <i>that
      I had done nothing.</i>** After the breviary prayers were concluded, there
      were only about three hours left daily for private study; and the
      spiritual work was to be performed in the midst of twenty youths who had
      no farther examination for office to undergo, and who besides were
      otherwise <i>finished!</i> It was with horror that I contemplated the
      possibility that my moral strength might be weakened by the influence of
      idleness and dissimulation. My case was therefore often desperate, and
      many a time in fever heat have I outwatched the night, and prayed in
      spirit "If it be possible, let the bitter cup pass from me." I was forced
      to drink it; but a gleam of prophetic brightness lighted me through the
      night, and showed me in my dreams the day of my emancipation. Miserably
      diseased in mind and disposition, I left the seminary in 1840.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The time was divided in the following manner:&mdash;Morning,&mdash;
     From 5 1/2 to 6, matins; from 6 to 7, breviary; 7 to 7 1/2,
     mass; from 7 1/2 to 8, breakfast; from 8 to 10, lectures;
     from 10 to 10 3/4, free; from 10 3/4 to 11 1/2, study;
     from 11 1/2 to 12, breviary. Afternoon,&mdash;Before and after
     dinner, prayers in the chapel&mdash;altogether about 3/4 of an
     hour; then 1/4 or 1/2 an hour breviary; from 2 to 4,
     lectures; from 4 to 4 3/4, free; from 4 3/4 to 7, study.
     After supper, about 1/2 an hour of prayer in the chapel and
     an hour breviary. The prayers are Latin, and always the same;
     a larger number on Sundays and feast days. It is the duty
     of every ecclesiastic to pray through the breviary once each
     day; the vicars go through these prayers for the canons as
     a sort of feudal service. The pupils are allowed, twice a
     week, to cross the threshold of the institution for a few
     hours only. No speaking is allowed during meals. The
     treatment is degrading. Two rooms for study are allotted to
     each twenty individuals. The sleeping places, without
     stoves, are arranged for three, six, eight, and fifteen.
     The largest was called <i>The Menagerie</i>.

     ** One of the Prebendaries themselves, at the time of our
     departure, called the Seminary "a little hell."

    <h2>
      THE WARNING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I entreat you, German parents, permit not one of your sons to enter this
      grave of moral freedom and independence; you draw upon yourselves a
      heavier weight of blame than if you took their lives&mdash;for the moral
      death is worse and more painful than that of the body! German mothers
      preferred in former times to put their children to death, rather than that
      they should be Roman slaves; while now-a-days it is esteemed the highest
      honour which can be conferred upon a German youth, that he should become
      the slave&mdash;the consecrated slave, forsooth&mdash;of the Roman bishop!
      But the yoke is not acknowledged, for it is imposed under the holy name of
      religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you, my youthful friends, who choose for yourselves the profession of
      teachers, let me conjure you to retire from this grave of moral strength,
      and independence&mdash;from the seminary! You will be losers there in mind
      and body, were you even giants in both! You will become slaves! You will
      become hypocrites! Attractive though the office of a teacher be, and
      enlarged his sphere of working, it is rendered a dangerous one for manly
      dignity&mdash;for truth and freedom, by the disgraceful ignominious
      fetters imposed on it by Rome. Choose, therefore, rather a hard couch and
      a laborious life than the degrading indolence of a polluted existence.

    <h2>
      MY DEPARTURE FROM THE SEMINARY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The gates of the Institution, which we were only permitted twice in the
      week to pass, to visit our fellow-men, at length were opened&mdash;the
      gates of that martyr-seminary for soul and body, that grave of
      independence&mdash;the proscribed threshold was crossed, and I beheld once
      more before me the free and lovely world; I inhaled long draughts of the
      fresh air, as I gazed on the free blue sky in all the brightness of the
      glorious sun. But the sun and the heavens were changed to me&mdash;the
      world itself seemed narrow and contracted, for my soul and spirit were in
      bonds, disgraceful bonds! I hastened to my native place&mdash;there, I
      fondly hoped, to lose my burden&mdash;there, where I dreamed the dreams of
      youth&mdash;there, in my mountain home! The kindly eyes of my brethren,
      said I to myself, will revive and warm this heart, which has been frozen
      by the hypocritical and piety-feigning glances of the domineering
      creatures of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the kindly eyes of my brethren <i>did</i> revive me, and the joy of
      meeting again <i>did</i> scare away the inworn pain of servitude; but
      before long the feeling returned with redoubled force. Dishonouring marks
      of reverence awoke me from my short-lived dream. An aged man approached,
      well-known to me, and dear from boyish years. I extended my hand to him&mdash;he
      fain would kiss it, the aged man! Is it not sufficient, I exclaimed within
      myself, that <i>I</i> should be a slave? Must I also be a tool to work the
      degradation of my fellow-men! O Rome, thou hast mixed poison in thy
      consecrated oil, to kill the dignity of man. I was regarded by all with
      timidity and reserve, as if I had all at once become a higher, a
      superhuman being! And how? By the fiat of the Pope? Oh, not a more exalted
      being; but a slave, who, by the practice of holy hypocritical pretence,
      was intended to deceive his fellow-citizens! So passed the first period,
      in dead stupefaction of soul, while I, adorned like a victim, was
      installed in the ceremonial service of the Romish Church. The thought of
      my father and my family, the prejudices of the Catholic world, which must
      believe, and for the most part <i>does</i> believe, in the eternal
      duration of the Roman bondage (called a Church,) paralzyed my spirit and
      my character. And yet, amid my fetters, there survived still <i>somewhat</i>
      to uphold me; a presentiment that my chains would break; a feeble ray of
      light illumining the dreary, and seemingly eternal darkness of my prison.
      But <i>when and how</i> should they be broken? I was now to be occupied in
      the cure of souls, the pulpit and the school attracted me&mdash;through
      them will I labour, thought I, my position may perhaps improve. So I went
      to Grottkau, whither I was called in March 1841.

    <h2>
      MY OFFICE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Firmly resolved to be a teacher of the people, in the true sense of the
      expression, not in that assigned to it by the Church&mdash;resolved to
      speak the truth, without respect of persons, and to become no hypocrite, I
      entered on my office at Grottkau. Being unacquainted in my sphere of
      labour, some time elapsed before I came to know my field of action, or was
      enabled efficiently to discharge the practical duties of my station. I
      found my school to be the field best adapted to the measure of my
      capacity. Independently of the natural love I have for children. I was
      always happiest in this holy garden of the Lord, where youthful minds
      expand, which is brightened by thoughts as swift and radiant as the
      lightning, and where the lovely innocence of childhood exhales its
      sweetest fragrance. In school I was free from the espionage by which I
      knew my pulpit to be surrounded&mdash;which oppressed my heart, and nearly
      stopped my utterance; free from the humiliating feeling which the
      Confessional aroused within me, where I seemed to be an idol, or a judge
      set over the thoughts and consciences of my fellow-men. When the pressure
      of the priestly yoke at times became too much for me, I have fled for
      refuge to the youth and innocence of the school, and have never failed to
      leave it with my strength renewed. These children little knew the infinite
      service which they rendered me! Notwithstanding that I laboured with all
      my might, as well in the school and the confessional, as in the pulpit,
      most resolutely to oppose and counteract the superstition, the hypocrisy,
      and all the consequences of priestly oppression and dissembling, the
      result could be but small, on account of the mighty barriers interposed by
      the hierarchy to every step in the direction of spirituality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within these fearful barriers, and under such restraint, and fettered thus
      in mind and body, with watchful care to sow and plant, what, after all,
      might be doomed to suffocation in the choke-damp of superstition, became
      from week to week less bearable; and all the less so, the more clearly I
      perceived the terrible effects of Popish despotism on the people, and the
      depth of moral degradation to which many of my brethren had sunk, bringing
      the danger all the nearer to myself. I saw it now to be my duty, openly to
      declare against the abuses and the soul-killing tenets of the Church of
      Rome,&mdash;rather to die a bodily than a spiritual death.

    <h2>
      MOTIVES FOR STANDING FORTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      AGAINST THE CONSTRAINT EXERCISED BY THE POPE IN MATTERS OF RELIGION.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inducements which gradually brought my determination to maturity, and
      imposed the carrying out of it upon me as a duty, I here submit to the
      consideration of all men:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I stand forth against the Romish hierarchy, because it is the means of
      crushing my dignity as a man, and reducing me to a state of disgraceful
      servitude.</i> The dignity of man is acknowledged to consist in his reason
      and his will, and in the unrestrained use of both, for the attainment of
      moral freedom,&mdash;"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which
      is in heaven is perfect." As Romish priest I dare not freely exercise my
      reason and my will. As such I only dare to think, and speak, and write,
      what the Church decrees, or what my superiors may allow. If I think, or
      speak, or write, more or otherwise, I am declared to be a <i>heretic</i>,
      i.e. a most grievous criminal. God himself must only be conceived of and
      adored, according to dictation of the Romish Church; and even He dares to
      accept no other adoration at my hands, than that prescribed by the Romish
      Church, in which, forsooth, salvation only can be found. As Romish priest
      I have no freedom, either of thought or conscience. Neither can I boast,
      as such, of any of the other rights of man, in opposition to my superior,&mdash;him
      I must blindly obey. The Romish priest is not regarded as a being
      personally free, but as an automaton, employed to spread abroad the mist
      of superstition. To cast off this bondage, and become a free moral agent,
      is a holy duty and injunction of the Christian religion, which demands
      freedom in the exercise of virtue. In order, however, to convince all men
      more clearly of the urgent nature of this duty, I shall attempt a feeble
      portraiture of the paralyzing influence exerted on myself, by priestly
      oppression, while I held an office in the Church&mdash;a portraiture in
      which the chief features in the case of hundreds among my colleagues may,
      at the same time, be recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt a morbid irritability in contemplating the consecrated barriers
      which cut me off from my fellow-men; my spirit, sympathy, and active
      impulse died away, and in their place, in spite of my endeavours, cold
      indifference, and emotions even of hatred crept upon me. I likewise felt a
      suspicion of my colleagues, inexplicable in its earlier stages, and, in
      particular, I shunned those friends in whose society I had passed the
      unfettered years of college life, in order that I might not unnecessarily
      open the wounds which the loss of my freedom had inflicted on my heart.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I have often heard the complaint made, that the younger
     members of the Catholic priesthood keep aloof from former
     friends; a moving cause is given above, which may lead us
     rather to compassionate than to condemn them.
</pre>
    <p>
      But most crushing of all was, the performance of certain ceremonies at the
      altar, by which, as I knew and could perceive, many of the community were
      misguided into superstition and hypocrisy. Was I not forced to be a party
      to dissimulation, in the performance of such ceremonies? Could I help
      feeling myself lowered in my own opinion? When I knelt at the altar, with
      the credulous people behind me, and cast a look within, I shuddered in my
      inmost soul, an unspeakable woe tormented me, and I uttered the despairing
      cry, "And hast thou so long suffered this humiliation?" Each morning I was
      awakened, as with a piercing shriek, by the thought that I was a slave,
      and that my life was not only useless but fraught with degradation to my
      fellow-men&mdash;that I had been robbed of a bright career of useful
      labour, and that not even time itself might put an end to all my ignominy!
      My fetters were indeed consecrated, and, according to the prejudices of
      the world, they seemed to be unremovable. The world appeared determined to
      bear patiently the hideous yoke&mdash;its course was still the same!
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw before me the abyss of falsehood or an early grave! Should I
      succumb? Unworthy cowardice! My courage gradually rose; courage for the
      contest of life and death within me. I determined to burst my fetters, and
      to leave the enchanted circle,&mdash;a circle drawn amid the incantations
      and the curses of Romish tyranny in the middle ages; I resolved to assist
      in tearing off the mask of holiness from the hypocrisy of a thousand
      years. This my resolve was only strengthened by contemplating the fate of
      my colleagues, some of whom were greater sufferers than even I. A few were
      snatched away by early death; they sank mute, and cheated of their lives,
      into the grave. He cannot surely have a drop of blood within his veins,
      who would not feel it boil with indignation to witness such a sight. And
      yet their fate was envied by the others, who glided through the world like
      mummies, in the springtime of their days, and hourly, slowly faded into
      death. Some rush, to deaden feeling, into drunkenness and other vices, or
      sink into insensibility, and passively vegetate from one day to the next.
      Others still, of livelier character, seek to lose themselves in the
      hierarchical spirit of the middle ages, and because ours are other days,
      and they, although they know it not, belong to <i>them</i>, have
      originated that modern species of bigotry which rises ofttimes into
      madness. Such heroes then surround themselves with halos borrowed from the
      early Fathers, and affect the startling voice of the preacher of
      repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I sought, in order quite to fix my resolution, the countenance of
      those among the priests esteemed of noblest character; but found little
      real manliness, good and amiable (?) as several of them might be,&mdash;-or
      from a certain vacuity of mind, effeminate inertness, or well-concealed
      ambition, might <i>appear</i> to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I stand forth against the tyrannical dominion of the Romish Hierarchy,
      because it prevents me from faithfully pursuing my avocation as teacher of
      the people</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am bound, as teacher of the people, and as teacher of religion, at all
      hazards to guard, not only my own freedom and independence, but those also
      of my fellow-men. In accordance with the language of the New Testament,&mdash;-"we
      are all the children of one father, we are brethren," it is my duty, as
      teacher of the people and of religion, not only to proclaim freedom to <i>all
      mankind</i>, but to endeavour to realize the lesson, because it is the
      freeman who alone is virtuous. It is, in fact, my duty as a teacher, not
      only to strive after intellectual perfection for myself, and to keep pace
      with the gradual development of mind, but to carry before my parishioners,
      the banner of civilization and humanity. I am not only impeded by the
      tyrannical oppression of the Romish Hierarchy in the discharge of all
      these duties, but am even commanded to proclaim bondage for freedom,
      darkness for light, and for progress&mdash;intellectual stagnation! I must
      thereby call down upon myself the deserved hatred of the present age, and
      the curses of posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I stand forth against the tyrannical dominion of the Romish Hierarchy,
      because I am convinced that what the Hierarchs call the Catholic religion
      is not the true Catholic doctrine,&mdash;is not a doctrine calculated to
      promote the happiness of nations; that the Romish, Hierarchy does not
      teach and act in accordance with the leading and fundamental doctrines of
      the religion of which Christ was the author,&mdash;but that it has
      introduced abuses, and framed ordinances which are calculated to undermine
      the intellectual and physical welfare of nations, and only to increase the
      power and riches of a privileged priesthood, of whom the Roman Bishop is
      the head.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It were superfluous here to attempt the proof of this position by a
      long-winded, learned treatise. The fruits of the Romish Hierarchy have
      been proving it for centuries, and it is in the power of every man to
      convince himself, who wishes to be convinced. Or is it perhaps in
      consequence of the <i>blessings</i> emanating from Rome, that a portion,
      and not a small one, of our people, languish in the most abject poverty?!
      while another portion, and within it many preachers of religion,
      especially the higher prelates, are rolling in superfluous wealth? Are
      these the fruits of a Church in which alone is salvation, that some should
      be kept by spiritual oppression and ignorance in superstition and
      insensibility, and even degraded to a level with the brutes, in order that
      others, and among them many consecrated servants of the Pope, may be the
      lords and drivers of the dishonoured horde! How then can the injunction of
      love to our neighbour find a place in such a Christian Church, in such a
      society of Christians? Where then is the succour of alone-saving Rome,
      amid so deep spiritual degradation, amid so great bodily want among our
      people? Where is the practical working of brotherly-love! where does she
      labour for the elevation and improvement of the people! Where is the right
      understanding of the Lord's Supper, the feet-washing! and where the living
      exemplification of so many others of the essential doctrines of the New
      Testament? Has it not all degenerated into form and pretence! Has not
      religion been degraded to a system of usury and hypocrisy, which aims
      alone at the enriching and aggrandizement of the Church of Rome! The
      Church, as the Romish Hierarchy exhibits and teaches, is but a phantom of
      falsehood and dissimulation, which floats unseen above the nations,
      keeping them in constant dread and blind obedience. Hence comes the
      alienation from the priests, the horror and bitterness of feeling
      unanimously entertained by the considerate and right-thinking portion of
      mankind, towards the so-called Romish Church! And the animosity is well
      deserved; for what efforts do the priesthood make for the temporal and
      spiritual amelioration of the suffering people? The greater number of them
      pass coldly by, as the priests and Levites passed by the poor Samaritan of
      old. We grant that hundreds of the priests are not aware, or are careful
      to avoid the knowledge of the game they play, and the Power they serve as
      blinded instruments. They speak, His true, of the spirit of <i>reconciliation</i>
      and the <i>Church</i>, but they halt by the dead letter. They know not,
      and they do not desire to know, that <i>the Church means all mankind, and
      mankind here on earth!</i> That the need of reconciliation is indeed most
      pressing, for mankind in its present condition&mdash;I mean a
      reconciliation and approximation of the educated and uneducated, the moral
      and immoral, portions of mankind. Yea, more, I mean a reconciliation
      between the rich and the needy portions of humanity. This reconciliation
      and approximation must be brought about preeminently by the teachers of
      the people; it must result, not in empty words&mdash;with them we have
      been surfeited&mdash;but in actual deeds. This is a vineyard of the Lord,
      where the ears are ripe for harvest, and where labourers are required.
      These labourers need no authority from Rome, no outward consecration&mdash;it
      must be in their spirits&mdash;they must have consecrated hearts! When
      they appear, the people will acknowledge them, although they bear no Roman
      symbols. But seeing that the Romish Hierarchy love no such labourers&mdash;the
      people's truest friends and guides,&mdash;seeing that she resolutely
      opposes the moral elevation of mankind, it is a duty to contend against
      her and her false system&mdash;and such is the duty I shall now endeavour
      to fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lastly, I stand forth against the tyrannical dominion of the Romish
      Hierarchy\ because its statutes tend directly to the sundering and
      oppression of my native land</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic priest is debarred by celibacy from the family tie,
      bound by his vow of blind obedience, by the tenets of his faith, as well
      as by external interest, to the Bishop of Rome, and thus withdrawn and
      estranged from the interests of his fatherland. Instead of awakening and
      strengthening patriotism and community of feeling, the Catholic priest, as
      teacher of the people, is engaged, by the statutes of his Church, <i>to
      stifle both</i>. History abounds with proofs of the truth of this
      assertion, with instances in which their fatherland, and the most sacred
      interests of their country have been betrayed, by bishops and priests, to
      the Roman Pontiff. But we dare not stop to consider the past; every day
      bears striking testimony that the priesthood strives with might and main,
      again to bring the German nation under the tyranny of the Pope and of the
      Jesuits. Hundreds, truly, of the priests are not aware of this; but what a
      load of guilt should <i>I</i> incur, were I to lend myself to the work of
      degrading and subjecting my fellow-countrymen,&mdash;of delivering my
      fatherland over to the Jesuits and the Pope! On the contrary, it is my
      bounden duty to contend against the despotism of Rome, and to lend a hand
      in working out the emancipation of my native country. These are the
      arguments which render it incumbent upon me&mdash;on all of us&mdash;to
      fight against the Hierarchy, and strive to bring about such an improvement
      and a reformation in the Church, as shall satisfy the requirement of the
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thorough reformation of the Church, it appeared to me, could only be
      brought about by General Councils,* in which laymen should bear their
      legitimate part; and I determined to lay down my views in writing on this
      subject, together with a sketch of the Romish abuses, which I expected to
      have ready by the autumn of 1843. The necessity for such a step was the
      more impressed upon my mind, the more I saw increasing the violence and
      lordliness of the High-Church and Jesuitical party throughout Germany, and
      particularly in Silesia, under Dr. Bitter, who was at that time Vicar of
      the Bishopric. Dr. Bitter disposed and managed all things to his own
      heart's content. Such curates and chaplains as did not please him were
      most unceremoniously deposed, translated, imprisoned, admonished in
      letters couched in Russian terms, and dealt with as suited his humour.
      Thus was Mr. Beer, the curate of Brieg, translated in defiance of his
      people's wish to retain him; Mr. Schotte was degraded to the lower office
      of chaplain, and Mr. Weiser, the chaplain, on a mere calumnious charge,
      without examination or opportunity of defence, ordered to the Seminary for
      punishment. These were men of unblemished reputation, their only fault
      being that they were not sufficiently abject and Romish. But Dr. Bitter
      rained and hailed on right and wrong, and enacted the part of Providence
      in the diocese of Breslau.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Even in the Seminary I spoke to several of my quondam
     friends, of the necessity of General Councils. Some of them
     have probably forgotten now, what then they acknowledged to
     be needed.
</pre>
    <p>
      The inferior clergy, who besides had few or no privileges in comparison
      with their superiors, were really most arbitrarily dealt with. A feeling
      came over us at that time, as if the days of club-law were at hand. In
      some places, as in Brieg and Ziegenhals, it really came to violence. But
      Ritter's creatures <i>rose</i>, and managed in the spirit of their master.
      He, in the fulness of his power, issued an interdict against mixed
      marriages, at once dishonouring to us, and injurious to chastity; he
      commanded that the old Silesian ritual, which probably dates from the time
      of trials for witchcraft,* (it contains at least much of the same stuff,)
      should again be brought into universal use, because he learned that some
      curates no longer employed it.** Neither did the Seminary escape him; he
      ordered the pupils never to mix with their fellow-men except in clerical
      costume, (probably for the sake of exemplifying neighbourly and brotherly
      love,) and enjoined it with suitable earnestness. Bigotry and fanaticism
      increased still more and more among the young and newly-appointed
      chaplains, and the old experienced ministers saw themselves all at once
      outdone in piety.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This expression is not too severe; for according to the
     Silesian ritual, in baptism, for instance, the Devil is
     three times driven ont of the innocent little child. At the
     consecrating of Holy Water, and at other consecrations, in
     like manner, a number of exorcisms are employed.

     ** At the same time, indeed, he promised a new one, which,
     however, after a lapse of three years, has not yet appeared.
</pre>
    <p>
      Numerous rosary associations and prayer-meetings were established.
      Schneeweiss, the professor of divinity, instituted such meetings in
      Neisse, and introduced rosary-books from Bavaria, which, pandering to the
      grossest materialism and sensuous worship, manifest the most horrible
      Jesuitism. The members paid weekly two silver groschen, which money, with
      that realized by the books, was reported to find its way into the coffers
      of the Jesuits in Bavaria. Herr Schneeweiss is generally considered in
      Neisse to be a Jesuit. The pupils at the High School were compelled to
      join these associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar reunions were established in other places, among which that under
      pastor Schaffraneck, at Beuthen, in Upper Silesia, was distinguished. Thus
      were we placed by Dr. Hitter, the <i>quondam</i> Hermesian,* quite on the
      ecclesiastical war establishment of the middle ages. Nothing now was
      wanting to Dr. Ritter, except monasteries and convents, for which pious
      mites were already beginning to be collected, and the bishop's mitre of
      Breslau. He lost his point, however; for Mr. Knauer, a mild and humane
      priest, was chosen. Now commenced a general intrigue among the High Church
      party. Mr. Knauer was complained of at Rome as incapable; Rome, therefore,
      hesitated for a year to confirm the appointment, during which time the
      agitation and disturbance in the diocese increased. Citizens and honest
      Churchmen in the province complained loudly of this bad state of matters;
      but neither the incorporation of burgesses, (who, to be sure, have no
      voice in matters affecting the good of their souls, or regarding their
      clergy,) nor a single pastor, deemed it incumbent on them to oppose the
      tide of disorder and of bigotry. Aroused by the disgrace of our
      increasingly gloomy prospects, and excited by the shamelessness of the
      creatures of Rome, as well as by the intrigues in regard to the bishopric
      of Breslau, which were daily coming to our ears, I resolved, although I
      had never yet written for publication, to attack the scandals which issued
      from the chapter of Breslau, and wrote the paper entitled, 'Rome and the
      Chapter of Breslau signed 'A Chaplain.'

      [This article appeared in No; 135 of the "Vaterlands-blatter," of the year
      1842, and runs thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "ROME AND THE CHAPTER OF BRESLAU.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Although a year has already elapsed since Prebend Knauer was chosen
      Bishop by the Chapter of Breslau, the appointment has not yet been
      confirmed at Rome, notwithstanding that the diocese has been two years
      without a bishop, and that other bishops, much more lately chosen, have
      been confirmed long ago. The circumstance excites, however, no surprise;
      for Knauer is a moderate, and humane, perhaps even a liberal-minded man.
      And yet it is somewhat strange that the Chapter of Breslau should submit
      so patiently to see its own and Knauer's honour so abused by Rome, and the
      rights of the diocese so disregarded! To object to this, that the Pope
      considers Knauer unfit for his office, were absurd. How should the Pope
      know aught about it, unless from informers, (his divine qualifications
      being now no longer admitted,) since the Chapter, by its choice, has
      declared him to be fit, and since it cannot be supposed that a college of
      venerable men would elect as bishop an unsuitable person, merely for the
      sake of appearances&mdash;not to advert to the influence of the Holy
      Spirit, whose efficacy would thus have been unrecognized in the election!
      But how can the Pope have more faith and confidence in a few pitiful
      informers, than in a whole college of men upon oath? How can he place
      these men in such an equivocal light before the eyes of the world, and so
      impede their usefulness in the diocese! Should this, however, happen, will
      not the Chapter incur a moral obligation, to vindicate its own and
      Knauer's honour, as well as to preserve the rights of the diocese?
      Hitherto the Chapter of Breslau has been silent. Is this from meekness? No
      one recognises in this silence an act of Christian forbearance, but
      somewhat very different! Of course, the people have learnt in the
      catechism, 'The Church is the community of all Christians, not the Pope.'
      People have strange notions in our day, especially about Church and State,
      freedom and the rights of man! All would fain have freedom and their
      rights, and, as they say, their warrant is in the Bible!
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will here be objected, however, that the Pope, having the right of
      confirming, has, consequently, also the right to refuse confirmation. Let
      us cast all else aside, even reason and honour, and consider the matter
      from the point of view of historical right, acquired by force. The Pope,
      then, has the right to confirm the bishop, consequently also to refuse
      confirmation; but the Chapter, in like manner, has the right of choosing,
      and, consequently, of not choosing&mdash;perhaps even the right of
      refusing admission to a bishop not elected by themselves. It is not
      difficult to determine whether Rome or the Chapter of Breslau would fare
      the worst in such a contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or may not the informers, who throw suspicion on the sentiments and
      fitness of Knauer, perhaps be members of the Chapter; and the Italians,
      presuming on their want of unity, venture to enact in Germany a part they
      have not dared for long? The silence of the Chapter and the impudence of
      Rome are scarcely capable of any other explanation. Should it indeed be
      so, and should individual members of the Chapter have sacrificed the
      welfare, the rights and privileges of the diocese, to their private
      ambition, their jealousy, or to other interests, and thus have made a
      level road for the Italians again to enter Germany, then would we call
      upon these men, who bear rule in the diocese, and whose part it is to
      promote our welfare, and to protect our rights and liberties, to vindicate
      their trust, if they do not wish to incur the reproach of want of
      principle, and dereliction of their duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are those days to return, in which it was necessary to send gold-laden
      cavalcades to Rome, in order to become a bishop? If so, the Canons of
      Breslau would have but faint chance of a mitre. It is very remarkable what
      the Italians have of late demanded of us Germans. We are commanded to pray
      that the Spaniards may return to their old ecclesiastical bondage! Who
      have been the leaders of this bloody drama? Perhaps the disobedient
      people? Espartero, and such like! We know in Germany, and almost every
      school-boy knows it, that, next to the tyranny of royalty, the bloody
      slaughtering of this fine people has been for the most part occasioned by
      the licentious, lazy, Rome-subjected priesthood! We also know that the
      French Revolution was not occasioned by Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and
      others of their stamp; but by the tyranny of Louis XIV., the profligacy of
      Louis XV., aided by the shameless excesses of the court nobility, lay and
      clerical. No less are we aware that the Thirty Years' War was not caused
      by Luther and Melancthon, but had been hatching for centuries by Rome and
      the lay and clerical nobility of Germany. It is, indeed, most necessary
      that we pray for ourselves and for the Spaniards, but it shall be for the
      freedom and independence of ourselves and them&mdash;in union with which
      alone can true religion and morality exist&mdash;and not for slavery and
      dependence, which can at best engender dissimulation and hypocrisy.

    <p>
      Well did I know that I was subscribing my own sentence; and yet, on closer
      consideration, I could not believe that the Hierarchy, or Church as it is
      called, would treat both truth and justice with such open scorn as I found
      that it could, through Dr. Ritter and the vicar-ship of Breslau.
    </p>
    <p>
      About six weeks after the appearance of the article, I received a note
      from Dr. Ritter,* in which he called upon me to tell him, on my priestly
      word of honour, whether I were the author of the article, "Rome and the
      Chapter of Breslau," or had taken any part in the drawing up or
      despatching of it. Dr. Ritter, the vicar of the bishopric, a priest,
      nearly sixty years of age, with grey hair, dared to call me to account for
      speaking the truth!&mdash;me, who, as a priest and proclaimer of the
      truth, had lately been sent into the world with the commission, "to speak
      the truth without fear of man,"&mdash;Dr. Ritter, who himself had sent me
      forth, ventured to call me to account for doing so! And is religion thus
      to be turned to mockery and reproach! Should I not speak the truth? or had
      I not spoken the truth? I had written down that the Romish priesthood were
      preeminently the cause of the German Thirty Years' War, and of the
      Revolutions in France and Spain. Are these not facts of historical
      notoriety, contained in every manual, and should I not dare to write them?
      I had also asserted that the calumnies and want of unanimity among the
      candidates for the bishopric, were probably the reasons for the Pope
      daring so long to delay the confirmation of Bishop Knauer, and keeping the
      diocese in confusion. The divisions and quarrels of the candidates for the
      bishop's mitre were known to all the diocese, and also <i>who</i> had
      principally contributed to the retiring of the humane Bishop Sedlinitzky&mdash;much
      indignation was felt at the discord occasioned by clerical ambition; and
      I, forsooth, should not give utterance to the opinions of my
      fellow-citizens and colleagues! Dr. Ritter, then, placed falsehood and
      hypocrisy on the altar, and desired that I should honour them, in calling
      me to a reckoning for my truthfulness.

     * DR. RITTER'S DECREE.

     "Public opinion points to you as the author of the article
     entitled "Rome and the Chapter of Breslau," and signed "A
     Chaplain," in No. 135 of the Saxon Vaterlands-blatter. I
     hereby require you, on your word of honour as a priest,
     distinctly to declare, by return of post, whether you are
     the author of the above-named article, or the sender of it,
     or, in fact, whether you had any share in the drawing up or
     despatching of the same.

     "Ritter,

     "Canonical Vicar and General Administrator of the
     Diocese,

     "Breslau, December 20, 1842."
</pre>
    <p>
      Had I given vent in words to my first angry feelings,&mdash;had I not
      allowed some weight to the existing relations between the higher and
      inferior clergy,&mdash;had I not, in short, considered the situation of my
      orphan sisters&mdash;Dr. Ritter would indeed have received a very
      different reply from that, which, after the exercise of much self-control,
      I sent him. After calm reflection and consultation with a man of
      experience, I came to the resolution, that as I had written in the name of
      my fellow-citizens and colleagues, I ought not to make any concession
      prejudicial to their rights, and must rely for protection on the laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the laws of Prussia, the name of an author can only be
      required, and that by the courts of law, when his writings contain matter
      of a libellous or seditious nature. If this law be not applicable to one
      of the inferior clergy, it follows that he dares not give utterance to any
      assertion or opinion which may be distasteful to his superiors (were it
      the most undeniable truth,) without being deprived of his situation. But
      who would willingly at once give up his place? Were governments to proceed
      after the fashion of Dr. Ritter, or the Church, no commissioned-officer
      would dare to notice an abuse, without running the risk of being examined
      and cashiered by his superiors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ritter had no right to take me to task, since by so doing, he
      interfered with the privileges and the duties of the whole body of
      inferior clergy, in calling me to account, by his inquisitorial questions,
      for a simple expression of opinion. I dared not accede to his demands
      without injuring religion and my colleagues. Or has the so-called inferior
      priest, perhaps, no right to tell the truth? or to tell it without placing
      his situation in jeopardy! Is the so-called inferior priest not under the
      protection of the laws of his native country? and are the superior clergy
      perhaps the only, and the infallible pillars of the truth? With a due
      regard to my good cause, and my defenceless condition, compared with that
      of an unfettered opponent, I gave the short reply&mdash;"that my
      conscience forbade me to satisfy such queries." The Papists and priestlike
      blockheads always turn the darkest side, and so they did in my case. Dr.
      Ritter and his Popish allies would gladly have attributed to me falsehood
      and cowardice, and pointed triumphantly to these words, as well as to
      other disconnected passages, in order thereby to lower me in the eyes of
      my fellow-citizens, but in vain. That I desired to save my place, as was
      asserted, by cowardice and falsehood, I have practically refuted, by
      demitting my office, braving poverty and want, although it would have been
      very easy for me, by falsehood or retractation, to have escaped from the
      suspension.*

    <h2>
      OBJECTIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the other hand, I have heard the objection made, that though I only
      wrote the truth, it was still unbecoming in me to write it as I did (?)
      Those good folks who so degrade the truth, and whose knees tremble before
      every tribunal, are informed, that it was not only my privilege, but my
      sacred duty so to write. The paper in question was written with the
      feeling of a <i>German</i>, who was ashamed and irritated, by seeing the
      despotic sway of Rome ever extending, wider and more boldly, and
      constantly employing for its extension (an extension which brings all
      vices in its train,) Germans&mdash;men whose paramount duty it is, as
      teachers of the people, to lead them to freedom and independence&mdash;since
      without <i>these</i> no virtue is conceivable. I wrote that article as a
      teacher of the people, and as a teacher of religion, who holds it as his
      most sacred duty to oppose all injustice, and to call it by its proper
      name, should it even be perpetrated under the shelter of the altar, and
      the hypocrisy of the more than millennial supremacy of Rome. There was
      besides somewhat peculiarly novel in Dr. Ritter's distinctive
      characterizing of the peculiar word of honour. He puts questions to me
      which I am called upon to answer on my <i>priestly</i> word of honour.
      Does Dr. Ritter always rate the quality of honour by the office of the
      individual? If so, are those who have no office also without honour! My
      honour is one and indivisible&mdash;that which God has implanted within me&mdash;the
      honour of being a man. This honour I esteem more highly than that priestly
      conceit with which, instead of love, Rome seeks by consecration to
      inoculate her slaves, and which generally sinks them far below the level
      of their fellow-men, though they may dream that they are high above them.
      My honour and my manly dignity are of greater value in my eyes than all
      your livings, prelacies, and mitres; and I am ready to defend my honour
      against every one, even against Dr. Ritter. Dr. Ritter will perceive from
      this that I was not lying bound, as he supposed, by that hierarchic spell
      which extinguishes reason, and de grades man's will to the condition of a
      limping slave. No, I had seen the Church beneath the screen of her
      hypocrisy&mdash;I had seen her in all her deformity, and I felt myself
      called on, at once by my manly dignity, and my love to my neighbour, to
      assist in tearing off her curse-laden mask.

    <h2>
      FARTHER EXPEDIENTS OF DR. RITTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As his Jesuitical plan of terrifying had not the effect which he probably
      desired, he tried other means to entrap me; and behold! a denunciation
      appeared to him likely to achieve his purpose. About a year before, it had
      been observed by a burgess nearly related to the priesthood, that I wore a
      shorter coat, and longer whiskers, than accorded with his orthodoxy, and
      he denounced me in consequence. Dr. Ritter had not delayed, from his giddy
      height of holiness, to set me right, in the genuine style of
      ecclesiastical dictation. I had replied to his communication in something
      like the following terms:&mdash;It would grieve me, by my external
      appearance, to give offence to any pious Christians, and I should gladly
      (though my present dress is exactly what I wore while in the Seminary)
      avoid it. I would indeed even relinquish my vocation were I considered
      unfit for it. I added at the close, that I might be able to exonerate
      myself in some particulars, but that I would not occupy, with such
      insignificant matters, his valuable time, which was doubtless demanded for
      the consideration of things of more importance.*
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding upon this, Dr. Ritter applied to Kaspar Hoffmann, clerical
      superintendent at Grottkau, and called upon him to report concerning me.**
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never interfered with this Kaspar Hoffmann. In money matters,
      usually an apple of discord between vicars and curates, I had allowed him
      to do as he pleased. He paid me only 32 dollars annually (16 were added by
      the town,) and derived handsome profits from offices, which I, perhaps,
      discharged for him,*** Still he would gladly have seen me removed, because
      we held opposite opinions, and I enjoyed the good-will of the community,
      which he seemed to grudge me. He truly reported the <i>crimina</i>, which
      he had perceived in me, and added, that he spoke the sentiments of <i>all</i>
      the citizens, although, as it afterwards appeared, he had <i>two</i> only
      on his side.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Dr. Ritter says In his lecture, when alluding to this
     occurrence, that he does not know whether I have vindicated
     myself.    Very satisfactory!

     **  Kaspar Hoffmann showed me this application before my
     departure.

     *** Curate Pech, a learned, accomplished, and distinguished
     man, wearied with the long-protracted contest, had taken a
     curate and retired.

     **** From one dollar, which I received for reading the
     burial service, he deducted 10 silver groschen. May I ask
     whether an usurer takes so large a percentage, as such a
     curate from his chaplain?
</pre>
    <p>
      These said crimes, as contained in the Decree of Deposition, are as
      follow:&mdash;1st, That I wore too short a coat, and unsuitably long hair.
      I could only treat this silliness with derision, gave therefore no reply
      to it, and direct my readers to the answer of my honoured defender, and to
      the testimony of the citizens and magistrates of Grottkau. I must,
      however, observe, that this accusation was only made as a pretence, the
      real ground of complaint being my conduct in the school and the church, as
      the following occurrence will disclose.* In the schools of which I was the
      director, I ordered the teaching of German history, caused the pupils to
      write exercises for the improvement of their style, commenced the
      formation of a juvenile library, and conducted the religious instruction
      not altogether according to the authorized Catechism, because I perceived
      that <i>it</i> tended rather to prejudice the minds of the pupils against
      religion than to implant it in their hearts. I visited, besides, the
      Sabbath-schools, and strove to rid them of superstition and hypocrisy.
      Kaspar Hoffmann, like many other suchlike <i>faithful</i> ministers, had
      instituted a regular system of espionage, and watched my doings. In his
      priestly zeal he slipped privately into one of my schools, put several
      bullying questions to the children, and when they, in terror, could not
      answer him a word, he beat the religion of love into them with a
      birch-rod. When I, enraged at his ill-treatment of the pupils, called him
      to account, he replied, that well-grounded doubts were entertained of my
      orthodoxy, that I did not proceed according to the accredited Catechism,
      <i>taught German history</i>, &amp;c.! This betrayed the quarter whence
      his inspiration had descended. My answer had, however, this effect, that
      Mr. Hoffmann discontinued his visits to my schools.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * My dress was quite black, and was far outshone in elegance
     by that of the clergy of Breslau. Besides, I know full well,
     that Catholic priests may deck themselves most gaily, and
     yet retain their offices.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the second place, Kaspar Hoffmann had reported that I conducted the
      ordinances of worship in an indecorous and undignified manner. This, in
      the sense in which he meant it, is a shameless lie; for, although I held,
      and still hold, many Church forms to be contrary to the exalted conception
      revealed to us of the Godhead in the Christian religion, (can it, for
      instance, be supposed, that God is honoured or the community edified, by
      unintelligible mumbling of Latin and hypocritical up-turning of the eyes?)
      I have still too great respect for all religious conviction, in whatever
      form it may be manifested, to insult it, or endeavour to bring about a
      change, in such a manner as I am represented to have done. I submitted to
      the forms prescribed, without, indeed, hypocritical up-turning of the
      eyes, whining, or the like, by which it is easy to acquire extravagant
      metage,* and a character for sanctity (I saw this shameless game played
      almost daily.)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The fee paid for the performance of masses.&mdash;Trans.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was, besides, a moral impossibility that I should have given offence by
      my remarkable behaviour, being so constantly galled and worn down by my
      bondage, and by my grief at being compelled to assist in disseminating
      superstition and hypocrisy, that I stood generally quite exhausted by the
      altar. Yes, the mental agony which I have endured on that spot, and which
      was manifested in my exterior, must have produced an exactly opposite
      impression than that for which he blamed me&mdash;and it did produce it.
      If Kaspar Hoffmann's piety took offence at this, then must it be
      equivalent to none, since he considered hypocrisy alone to be true decency
      and dignity. (What remains to be said on this subject will be found in my
      Defence before the Council.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, It had been reported that no one would take me for a Catholic
      Clergyman who did not know me to be one. This, I must confess, sounded to
      me very like the language of praise, as I have endeavoured never to make
      any distinction between myself and my fellow-citizens, seeing that I
      desired to be neither more nor less than a man and a citizen. Does the
      narrow blue stripe constitute the pastor and teacher? We know that lying
      and feigned words are uttered in spite of the clerical stripe, and that
      the glittering vestments of the priest cannot shut out dissimulation, but,
      on the contrary, that they promote it.

      LETTERS OF PERSUASION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      DESIRES OF MY OFFICIAL COLLEAGUES.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to this charge to Kaspar Hoffmann, Dr. Ritter had commissioned
      a zealous divine of the younger school,* to persuade me to retract. On the
      1st and 15th of January 1843, I received letters from him, and from a
      narrow-minded priest in the College at Neisse, in which, under cover of
      the most high-flown expressions of Christian brotherly-love, I am required
      to become a contemptible liar. As these letters are written in
      ecclesiastical style, and reveal the character of Dr. Ritter&mdash;his
      artifices, and those of the men who permit themselves to be made his
      tools, I consider myself called upon to publish them: besides, the writer
      is no friend of mine, as the Decree of Suspension falsely intimates, but
      merely an acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had at first almost believed that the assurances of friendship contained
      in the letters of Schneeweiss were true, in spite of their suspicious
      highflying; and although I had already, in like manner, been deceived by
      others of my colleagues, I was almost tempted to believe in their honesty.
      But after the epistle of the narrow-minded priest had betrayed to me that
      Dr. Ritter was in the game, I was forced to despise the letter-writer as a
      hypocrite. Schneeweiss feigned friendship, but he could have no respect,
      and therefore no friendship, for me, when he recommended me to commit an
      act of baseness, namely, the denial of well-known facts&mdash;the shameful
      recall of that which I had lately asserted&mdash;and a cowardly and
      degrading submission to the despotism of Dr. Ritter. I suppose, also, that
      Schneeweiss had imagined that I was quite imbued with hierarchic views. He
      might in that case represent the blind and cowardly submission as an act
      of virtue on my part; but he could not expect that I should retract the
      blame I attributed to the quarrels and <i>informings</i>* of the
      candidates for the episcopate, and even my censure of the long delay on
      the part of the Pope&mdash;for they were injurious to the Church. Had he
      considered my station as a Catholic priest, as a teacher of the people,
      and of religion in the sense of Christ's teaching, and desired to be
      accounted such himself, he could not have advised me to a disgraceful
      retractation and denial of a truth which I had dared to avow. No; he would
      have encouraged me to bear unflinching testimony to the truth, and in the
      face of greater danger than the loss of office.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Compare the Decree of Suspension of January 30th, 1843.
</pre>
    <p>
      For that <i>is</i> true, which I have written; the quarrels and intrigues
      of the candidates for the bishop's mitre, I repeat it, have been proved,
      and they were (I myself have heard it,) the theme of scandal and censure
      at once to priests and laymen. It was disgrace enough to the clergy, that
      no one of the elder ministers dared openly avow his censure&mdash;that
      they loved their livings more than truth and their fair name. But
      Schneeweiss does not seem to have thought of these things. It may be
      gathered from the mixture of assertions and contradictions in his letters,
      that he was not quite clear of the propriety of what he required of me, at
      the same time that he does not seem very well to know what he would be at.
      However, so it also happens with many others of my colleagues. They become
      inconsistent in their opinions; for, being called to fight in the front
      rank for truth and freedom, they, on the contrary, act in opposition to
      them, as the conscious or unconscious slaves and servants of the
      hierarchy. I fancied, when I knew Schneeweiss in earlier days, that he had
      a more enlightened zeal, but Gibbon's words, alas! are true&mdash;"The
      spirit of bigotry, at once so credulous and insinuating, when it has once
      taken root in a noble mind, overturns by degrees the living principles of
      virtue and of truth."

      LETTERS OF SCHNEEWEISS AND GLÕCKNER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "My Dearly Beloved Brother,&mdash;You will be surprised to receive a
      letter from me, but do not let your surprise induce you to forget that it
      is sincere affection which prompts me to address you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just learned in Neisse that a heavy storm is gathering over you.
      You are said to be the author of an article in the Saxon
      Vaterlands-blatter, in which language is employed very unlike what one
      would expect from any Catholic, not to speak of a Catholic priest. It is
      also said, as I am assured by an otherwise trustworthy and respectable
      man, that you have been questioned in regard to it by the right reverend
      Administrator of the Bishopric, and that you have returned a very evasive,
      answer. If it be really so, Oh, let me entreat that you will not neglect
      to say at once Pater, <i>peccavi!</i> (Father, I have sinned!) Write
      immediately to the right reverend Vicar, and assure him, with a
      self-denial which would be highly honourable (?) to you, that you wrote in
      well-meant (?) precipitation. If you do not follow my brotherly counsel,
      you may expect, from the determined character of the right reverend Vicar,
      soon to be suspended (deposed), as I have also learned from respectable
      authority. And to what would this suspension lead! Oh, believe me, my dear
      brother, it would then be no longer in the power of your former friends to
      help you. So long as we are Catholics, Rome must always be to us the
      centre point of the visible Church; and so long as we wish to be Catholic
      Christians, and particularly priests&mdash;servants of the Catholic
      Church, we dare not speak and write of Rome in such a slighting manner,&mdash;I
      might say, with the hatred and contempt exhibited in the article, which I
      have also read. I assure you, that not even Protestants would take you
      under their protection, if you are really the author of that article. I
      will not speak of Catholics. In so far as I am concerned, I marvelled at
      the author's deficiency in historical and theological knowledge, who had
      subscribed himself 'A Chaplain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be not offended at my openness. A well-meaning brother must not hesitate
      to speak the truth even at the risk of the momentary loss of a brothers
      affection. I entreat you once again to do immediately what I advise. I
      know you to be an otherwise well-disposed person (<i>what honour!</i>); it
      would grieve me to see you brought into a position which cannot,
      now-a-days, be honourable (<i>do I not understand?</i>). It is
      great-minded to make amends for faults and for offence which one may have
      given! and little-minded to have the courage only to impugn time-honoured
      truths, without acknowledging the fact as soon as questioned by those who,
      in virtue of their station, have a right to demand the acknowledgment;*
      and so, dear friend, behave wisely and well, and turn away all evil from
      yourself. Make my respects to your Vicar.

      at present&mdash;I mean the article in the Vaterlands-blatter. The paper
      had lain here unnoticed for several weeks, when it accidentally fell into
      my hands at the house of Baumgarten the merchant; and on account of its
      bitter, passionate tone, not only in regard to the Pope himself, but the
      extent of his authority&mdash;on account of certain hints in regard to the
      narrowing of the power of the bishops and the want of the proper conduct
      of the cure of souls, which the people have a right to expect, as the
      grace of the Church, from the apostolic vicars and curates&mdash;in short,
      on account of all these circumstances, I hastened to submit it to
      Schneeweiss for inspection. But besides the Number which contained this
      article, there was another, and indeed the preceding one, which at the end
      gave a list of the contents of the letter box, and also mentioned a
      contribution from Grottkau. This it was which led to the suspicion that
      you were the author. Full scope was now given for violent discussion at
      the parsonage, and they wished at once to inform you of the suspicion
      under which you lay. An opportunity was found in candidate N., who, at the
      suggestion of Schneeweiss, was enjoined to call upon you on his homeward
      journey to Breslau, and disclose all to you,&mdash;but nothing farther. No
      application to Ritter was made from hence, and, according to the
      declaration of Schneeweiss, N., who is at present in the Seminary, must
      have blabbed there. Since your embarrassment is now known, that is to say,
      Ritter's threat in case you should not confess&mdash;Schneeweiss has
      written to you at once, Ritter having expressed a wish that your friends
      and brethren in this quarter should come to an understanding with you, and
      try to move you to a retractation of the article. Schneeweiss, much
      puzzled at not hearing from you, has again applied to Ritter, through
      Peschke in Breslau, to endeavour to stave off the execution of the threat,
      and successfully, as we yesterday learned. Peschke advises him strongly to
      persuade you to confess, in which case nothing more would be demanded of
      you than that you should insert a modified article in the same paper,
      without signature, and adds, 'If you had not entreated for him, Ronge
      would already have been proceeded against&mdash;he would have been
      suspended.' I have already told a long tale, but not yet come plainly to
      the point which so much annoys me. It is this,&mdash;through <i>me</i> it
      was that the article first became known to the clergy, and I should
      bitterly reproach myself were you to be brought into trouble on account of
      it. You may judge from this what comfort it would afford me were you to
      relieve me from my unpleasant situation by a settlement of the affair. Do
      it for my sake, (?) regard my peace of mind, should it cost ever so great
      a sacrifice! It involves no sacrifice of conscience&mdash;such a sacrifice
      no one has a right, <i>ex abrupto</i>, to demand. The Catholic Creed is
      not involved&mdash;otherwise, I apprehend, from your straightforward
      character, you would no longer be holding office in the Church. I beseech
      you, therefore, to relieve me from my painful situation, where I am
      tortured now, and may be incurably tortured at a future day, should you be
      overpowered. S. would gladly talk over with you this unpleasant affair, if
      it were agreeable to you to come here; and, if that be inconvenient, he
      will employ his acquaintance with Ritter to facilitate an adjustment. Ask
      N. also, who knows me,&mdash;and I think you will entertain no suspicion
      of my sincerity. Perhaps he may even accompany you, which would delight
      me. He also is among the shipwrecked ones. With all brotherly love, your
      friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      "GLOCKNER."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 15th of January I received a second letter from Schneeweiss, which
      differs essentially from the former one. If the tone of the first is
      lordly and dictatorial, that of the second is gentle, more prudent, is
      addressed to me as an individual, and calls in my nationality to his
      assistance:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Dear Brother,&mdash;Once more I write you a short letter, although I
      feel nearly persuaded that you will not thank me for it. My former hasty
      lines have remained quite unnoticed. Were I actuated by any other motive
      than affection, I might feel myself somewhat slighted, but love bears all,
      hopes all, and does all, that can promote the welfare of a brother (?!).
      Once more I beg of you to bring this unhappy affair in Breslau to a
      conclusion. I assure you that your character, supposing you to be the
      author of the article in question, shall not be compromised (<i>how
      forbearing is our mother Church!</i>), as I know from an authentic source.
      Believe me, you have injured yourself by your evasive answer,&mdash;it
      will not bring you out of your scrape.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Act resolutely! If you be the author of the article, answer, like a man,
      'Yes I am,' and submit to reproof (<i>indeed!</i>). If you be not the
      author, answer also in that case like a German man (<i>even this chord the
      Church does not disdain to strike!</i>)&mdash;'No, I am not.' If your time
      permits, pray visit me for a few hours. Things are more easily explained
      when face to face. You have no time to lose, as I learn from a sincere and
      honest friend in Breslau.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only believe that I love you sincerely while giving you this advice.
      Should you consider me mistaken or shortsighted, I cannot help it. You
      may, in time, be convinced that these lines are dictated by the purest and
      most anxious affection. God be with you, and with your sincere friend.

      THE SEVENTY CURATES
    </h2>
    <p>
      About the same time seventy Silesian curates inserted a most pathetic
      article in "The Sion," and, in an address to Dr. Ritter, implored him to
      call me to account, and, if I made any difficulty, to depose me. As I
      afterwards learned, this address was not peculiarly well received at the
      Chapter, but Dr. Ritter issued a letter of thanks.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * "I thank you for the Declaration you have sent to me from
     seventy clergymen, in regard to the affair of Ronge, and
     request you hereby to express to them my acknowledgments and
     thanks. The diocese of Breslau may rejoice (if Ritter
     compose the diocese) that it possesses such a company (why
     not flock!) of worthy young men in the vineyard of the Lord.
     Chaplain Ronge is already suspended, and has been summoned
     to the Seminary at Breslau.   Should he offer any
     resistance, I shall commission the Right Reverend Vicarial
     Board to dismiss him, without further delay, from the
     service of the Church.&mdash;Ritter.

      I have not replied to these seventy brethren, because I heard that the
      greater number had signed it from fear of Ritter; but I consider that I
      have atoned for the neglect, seeing that whilst they, according to
      promise, were probably praying for me, I worked industriously for them.

      THE DEPOSITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After Dr. Ritter had also asked my friends in vain, whether I had hinted
      to them anything about their article, the Decree of Suspension was sent to
      me. Dr. Ritter had, at the same time, issued an order to a portion of the
      Silesian curates, to refuse me the administration of all religious
      ordinances. They, on their part, had issued the like order to their
      bell-ringers and sacristans, so that, owing to the zeal of many of those
      individuals, I could visit no church, without running the risk of causing
      a disturbance, or being turned out.

    <h2>
      DECREE OF SUSPENSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The right reverend Board of Administration made known to us, on the 11th
      of this month, that, as public opinion had pointed you out as the author
      of the well-known article, "Rome and the Chapter of Breslau," you had been
      asked, on the 20th December last, whether you really were so. You replied
      to this question, on the 24th of the same month, that you could not
      reconcile it to your conscience to answer the question put to you by the
      right reverend Board. Time was allowed to you after this, and a vicar, a
      private friend * of your own, was commissioned to encourage you to make a
      distinct declaration and acknowledgment, in which case you would still
      have been treated with indulgence.** Up to this time, however, you have
      sent no reply to the right reverend Board, wherefore we have been charged
      by the same to bring you to an investigation, *** eventually, however, to
      suspend you, and to summon you, <i>ad exercitia</i>, to the Seminary in
      this place. It has been further shewn to us, by Mr. Rector Hoffmann of
      Grottkau,**** that so early as the 29th of October 1841 you had been
      seriously rebuked by the right reverend Board, on account of your peculiar
      dress and unsuitably long hair; and although Hoffmann, and several others
      of your colleagues, kindly warned you of the impropriety of your dress,
      all has produced no effect, so that they who did not personally know you,
      would never take you for a clergyman. In addition to this, it has been
      said that you performed the priestly functions without decorum or dignity,
      (<i>in plain German, without hypocrisy and grimaces</i>,) whereby you have
      occasioned manifold offence, (<i>unfortunately, the community has accused
      the right reverend Board of falsehood</i>,) and impeded the efficacy of
      your ministry.(v) Since, under these circumstances you cannot be appointed
      to the cure of souls, as you yourself, on calm reflection, (<i>how
      liberal!</i>) on your sentiments and your efficacy, (<i>why were not these
      two important items earlier introduced?</i>) must perceive.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I leave the reader to frame his own opinion of this
     procedure, and of the friend who allows himself to perform
     the office of a spy.

     ** Why did Dr. Hitter make so great a work about the matter,
     if he wished to appear indulgent?

     *** What the right reverend Board understand by an
     investigation, is shown at the end of this Decree.   I shall
     also give my idea on the subject.

     ****  Why does the right reverend Board conceal the fact,
     that Kaspar Hoffmann was required to report! He himself
     showed me the requisition; and we know full well that my
     Lords are accustomed to have even the slightest indications
     of a wish on their part most carefully attended to by their
     obedient servants. Hoffmann naturally strove to please Dr.
     Ritter, and prepared his information accordingly.

     (v) It is scarcely credible that an entire Chapter should
     wander so wide of the truth. The town of Grottkau professes
     to have found in me "zealous energy in the improvement of
     youth."
</pre>
    <p>
      Since we forbid you the exercise of priestly functions, you are
      hereby-charged to leave your present situation immediately on receipt of
      this&mdash;to resort to the Seminary in this place, there to undergo <i>exercitia
      spiritualia</i>, to submit yourself entirely to the orders of the master
      of the Seminary, i. e., the Pro-Rector, Dr. Sawer, to whom you are
      required to announce your arrival in this place, and await our further
      commands.*

      DECLARATION ON THE PART OF THE TOWN OF GROTTKAU.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the very day on which my deposition was made known, (without any
      prompting on my part,) I received a Declaration, to be forwarded to the
      right reverend Council, from the undersigned individuals (all
      Catholics.)**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     ** DECLARATION BY THE TOWN OF GROTTKAU.

     "It affords the undersigned individuals the greatest
     pleasure to be enabled, in all truth and duty, to assure
     their vicar, Mr. Ronge, that he has never given occasion of
     offence to the public, either by his dress, his behaviour,
     or otherwise; nor has there been anything unbecoming in his
     everyday life and conversation; or in the manner of his
     performing the functions of his priestly office.

     "On the contrary, Mr. Ronge has justly acquired the
     universal love and esteem which he so richly enjoys, by his
     modest and highly decorous conduct, by the exemplary
     morality of his life&mdash;which even the foulest calumny has
     never ventured to assail&mdash;and, further, by his zealous
     energy in the improvement of youth, as well as by his
     friendly and winning carriage towards all men."

      <a name="linkimage-0001" id="linkimage-0001">
      <!-- IMG --></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This Declaration, and my own Defence, I forwarded without delay to the
      Reverend Council, with the observation, that I should also send a
      testimonial from the magistracy of Grottkau, so soon as I should receive
      it. After the Declaration had been despatched, several other citizens
      desired to sign it, and complained that it had not been sent to them. It
      will not be a difficult matter for my fellow-believers and townsmen to
      make comparisons of the Decree of Suspension and the Declaration of the
      town of Grottkau, and to draw their own conclusions as to which party were
      in the right. Without further remark, therefore, I shall merely put the
      following questions:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I. Why was I suspended, and condemned to degrading imprisonment? and
    </p>
    <p>
      II. How was I treated?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was suspended, and condemned to degrading imprisonment&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I. Because, in fulfilment of my vocation as pastor and teacher, I had
      reminded the episcopal candidates of their duty. Had I, perhaps, no right
      to do so? Yes, it was my privilege and duty,&mdash;because I was, and <i>still
      am</i>, a teacher of religion, and dare not as such betray the truth, even
      to obtain thereby a rich living for my treachery. Or, are the prebends of
      Breslau infallible? They are as little so as I or any other man. If Dr.
      Ritter, and the other members of the Chapter, desire to represent the
      Christian religion&mdash;that religion of which truth and love are
      essential conditions&mdash;they must take courage to hear the truth
      itself. If I spoke the truth, why was I smitten on the face? Was I,
      perhaps, as chaplain, considered too insignificant an individual to
      deserve such notice? I dare not suppose this of those whose duty it is to
      teach and exemplify the doctrine&mdash;"We are all the children of one
      father, we are all equal in the sight of God,"&mdash;and with whom, in
      respect of ordination, I was on an equality. If, however, they have not
      understood these words of the gospel, I shall shew that I at least have
      comprehended them&mdash;for I shall not intermit my endeavours to arouse
      the inferior clergy, oppressed and trampled on as they are, from their
      moral wretchedness, ignominy, and bondage&mdash;because I know what they
      suffer and how their hearts bleed, having bled and suffered with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was besides deposed, because I had offended by my dress and the cutting
      of ray hair, and because I had set dignity and decorum at defiance in my
      performance of the priestly functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      These accusations have been sufficiently exposed as untrue by the
      Declaration of the town of Grottkau. Were they, however, in fact, not
      altogether unfounded, (which they have been shown to be,) let them for a
      moment be compared with the vicious practices of a no small portion of the
      right reverend servants of the Pope, who, notwithstanding the unanimous
      condemnation of public opinion, are left in quiet possession of their
      offices!&mdash;&mdash; However painful it may be for me, and presuming
      though it may seem to others, I cannot refrain from opposing my moral
      character to the high station of those men, who are accustomed to refer
      everything to mere sensuality, and to drag down all things into the mire;
      and I demand, why was I not accused of drinking, gambling, or of some
      particular crime!! Why am I not accused by the right reverend Council of
      some negligence in the discharge of my duty? Did they ever hear even one
      equivocal report in regard to my moral character!
    </p>
    <p>
      II. How was I proceeded against!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was suspended, and condemned to dishonouring imprisonment, without a
      hearing&mdash;without an opportunity of defence, or proof adduced of my
      culpability.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unlawful that any German or Prussian citizen should be imprisoned
      for a crime, by any other than the civil executive power. It is only the
      Catholic priest that is liable to be coerced without appeal to his civil
      rights, or the ceremony of a trial. The Apostle Paul laid claim to the
      privileges of a Roman citizen; while the Roman Church herself denies to
      her followers the exercise of the most ordinary civil rights. I did not,
      therefore, submit to the sentence!

    <h2>
      REASONS FOR NOT SUBMITTING TO THE ORDERS OF THE RIGHT REVEREND BOARD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To this finding of the Vicarial Council, dictated by ecclesiastical
      caprice, without regard to the law of the land, or even to the statutes of
      the Church, it was impossible for me to submit&mdash;and I did not submit
      to it; because I should have thereby degraded, <i>first</i>, my moral
      dignity; <i>secondly</i>, the honour of the nation; and, <i>thirdly</i>,
      the rights of the whole body of inferior clergy, by a cowardly submission
      to the unjust and disgraceful punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, my moral dignity was slighted. If I am bound <i>as a
      man</i> to resist all violent infringement of my freedom and individual
      privileges, and rather to hide a free and virtuous heart beneath the
      poorest clothing, than to strut about as a slave in rich attire,&mdash;I
      am still more solemnly engaged to such a course, as <i>teacher of the
      people</i>. As such also, in order to bear vigorous and successful
      testimony to the truth, I must maintain an unblemished reputation among my
      fellow-citizens. The right reverend Board, however, have at once assailed
      my freedom and my honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the citizen of a civilized state, and belonging to a civilized nation,
      where the law and not caprice is paramount, I should have compromised the
      national honour, had I, the subject of such privileges, submitted in a
      cowardly and passive manner to the despotical dictation of a foreign
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lastly</i>, seeing that it is at once the duty and the privilege of
      every teacher of the people (as also of each vicar,) to speak the truth
      without respect of persons, I should have incurred the guilt of
      sacrificing the privilege and duty of the whole body of inferior clergy,
      by tame submission to the power of those who thus dispute the one, and
      hinder us in the performance of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards the latter, the inferior clergy have certainly renounced their
      duty, when, in opposition to their superiors, they have submitted to be
      robbed of this&mdash;and many other of their rights as men&mdash;and to
      see themselves reduced to the condition of blind slaves; but the cowardice
      of many in the past and present time, cannot relieve me or any other man,
      from the duty of guarding intact the possession of our civil rights. I am
      only the more solemnly bound most vigorously to contend for all our
      rights,&mdash;as men and citizens, and to free myself from slavery,&mdash;the
      more clearly I perceive, that by the slavery of the popular teachers, the
      moral and physical suffering of the people is ensured. Does a man cease to
      be a citizen when he becomes a priest?

    <h2>
      MY DEFENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On receipt of the Decree of Suspension, I took the <i>legitimate</i>
      course (if such a term applies,) and sent in a Defence to the right
      reverend Board, along with the Declaration of the town of Grottkau, and
      testimonials from the authorities. But I was so excited by the calumnies
      which I found in the Decree of Suspension, that I was but ill fitted to
      write a calm defence. I felt myself therefore laid under great
      obligations, which I embrace this opportunity of again and publicly
      acknowledging, to a Catholic lawyer, who offered, in the noblest and most
      friendly manner, to take the necessary steps. I did not, indeed, conceal
      from this my honoured defender, my determination at once to demit my
      office, should they proceed to execute the threatened and dishonouring
      sentence,&mdash;but left him otherwise at liberty,&mdash;in order to shew
      to my fellow-citizens, that even the most modest proposals and requests on
      my part, and the sufficiently distinct expression of feeling on the part
      of the town of Grottkau, as well as of the rector and the principal
      inhabitants, were alike unavailing to effect the rescinding of the unjust
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right Reverend Canons,
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been deeply moved by hearing the sentence of your right reverend
      Council, held on the 30th of last month, which orders my suspension from
      office; in the <i>first</i> place, because I am convinced that worthless
      men have shamefully traduced my character; and, farther, because I have
      been publicly branded, and deprived of honour and office, on the strength
      of a current report, and on the credit of a private informer, without
      communication of the charge, or awaiting my vindication. The cause of my
      answering, as I did, the question whether I were the author of the article
      entitled, "Rome and the Chapter of Breslau," was this: that I felt
      exceedingly annoyed at being asked,&mdash;and vexed, that I, who live here
      in the most perfect retirement,&mdash;serving all men as I have
      opportunity,&mdash;should be called on to defend myself from empty
      rumours, and be subjected to the necessity of allowing persons, with whom
      I am not on a friendly footing, to use the most impertinent language
      towards me, under the guise of brotherly affection, as my colleague
      Schneeweiss has done. If the right reverend Board believe that I am the
      author of the article, and consider it offensive, I expect that, agreeably
      to the laws of Prussia, the authorship shall be-brought home to me by
      proof; until then, I do not consider myself called upon to render account
      regarding it to any one. I might otherwise, with equal propriety, be held
      to be the author of any anonymous production, and should have time for
      nothing else than constantly assuring and bringing proof, that I lead a
      retired life, and trouble myself neither about worldly nor clerical
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The denunciation by Hoffmann, I here declare to be a contemptible
      falsehood. My hair is not an inch longer than that of Hoffmann. That it
      curls naturally, while his is smooth, is no fault of mine. Besides, I may
      observe, that on account of headache, I never allow my hair to be cut
      quite short. My dress is of a dark colour, like that of other respectable
      citizens; and the reason that my coat is some inches shorter than that of
      Hoffmann, is, that it is of newer fashion. I am young, healthy, vigorous,
      and, it is said; spirited; hypocritical bigotry is foreign to my nature,
      and hateful to me. I assume no other manner in the performance of my
      priestly functions than that of ordinary life. It may be that Mr. Hoffmann
      makes lower bows, beats his breast with deeper groans; it may be that this
      imposes upon uneducated people, but, to my thinking, it bears no proof of
      piety, nor does it elevate the feelings of educated men. I would even say
      that my unvarying behaviour must tend to convince the congregation that I
      am sincere,&mdash;that that which I preach is my own conviction,&mdash;that
      my words proceed not merely from my lips, but from my inmost heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dignity and decorum are relative ideas, and the answer to the question&mdash;who
      possesses them? depends upon the view entertained by the individual who is
      appealed to. It is well if Hoffmann and my other secret accusers can
      comfort themselves with the consciousness of possessing dignity and
      decorum. I hope the contrary may never be proved of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I am devoid of these two fancied qualities, they have been denied to me
      by nature, and I am therefore not to blame; I do not repress decorum and
      dignity; I do not purposely neglect them, and I expect a proof to the
      contrary&mdash;for it is only when the intentions are evil that our
      actions can be blamed. That I had given great cause of offence to the
      congregation was unknown to me until now.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the clergyman of this place, where a portion of the congregation is
      highly educated, another portion tolerably, while a third is altogether
      uneducated, it is peculiarly difficult to satisfy all parties. I thought,
      therefore, that the most prudent course for me to pursue, would be to vary
      my sermons, and address myself by turns to either class. If my point has
      not been gained, and all parties have not been equally satisfied, it has
      arisen from a fallacy in the plan, not from premeditated carelessness on
      my part, which alone would be culpable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without egotism, I may say that the annexed testimonial* from the Catholic
      gentry, the most respectable citizens, and regular church-goers of this
      town, appears to me to prove that my labours have not been fruitless, and
      that at least I have given no public cause of offence.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I have printed this testimonial with its signatures, for
     the sake of contrast, immediately after the Decree of
     Suspension, and give here the testimony of the authorities.
</pre>
    <p>
      Although I consider that, by this testimonial, the secret and shameful
      accusations against me have been sufficiently refuted, still, for my more
      perfect exculpation, I shall also produce the testimony of the magistrates
      and sheriffs of this place, which will not, certainly, be found less
      favourable. I cannot possibly believe that your right reverend Council,
      after I have proved a portion of the accusation to be untrue, will carry
      out in full severity the sentence of the 30th January.
    </p>
    <p>
      I beg, therefore, humbly to request, should the sentence be so far
      modified as to leave me in possession of my office, that I may be
      translated as soon as possible, seeing that even in the exercise of all
      Christian forbearance, it must still be disagreeable for me to live so
      near my false accuser, and to eat at his table.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lively hope that your right reverend Board will not publicly
      condemn me on false accusation, marring my earthly prospects, and robbing
      me of my credit as a citizen; but, on the contrary, that it will remove my
      Suspension, I shall await here the arrival of a very different decision,
      especially as the production of the necessary witnesses, and the
      arrangement of my affairs, require my presence here for some days longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the rest, I have announced my suspension to Mr. Hoffmann, and shall
      not venture on the performance of any priestly functions until the arrival
      of the longed-for reversal, which must most clearly show, that my
      non-appearance in the Seminary does not proceed from contumacy.*
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides my own Defence, and the voluntary Declaration by which the town of
      Grottkau nobly and honourably annihilated the accusations heaped upon me,
      I sent to the right reverend Council (about six days later) the
      testimonials from the authorities of Grottkau, which I applied for to
      assist in my vindication. They run thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * THE TESTIMONIALS OF THE AUTHORITIES OF GROTTKAU.

     "Of the Rev. Vicar Ronge, it is hereby certified, at his own

     morally correct life, and, in so far as we know, has always
     conducted himself towards the inhabitants in an affectionate

     as vicar, I have perceived nothing in him that could
     compromise him as a Catholic clergyman. Neither have I heard
     that he has performed his spiritual functions without
     reverence or dignity, or that there has been anything
     offensive in his dress, or the cutting of his hair. Every
     individual has his failings and peculiarities, of which even
     accusers are not free, and it is generally easy enough to
     injure a man, and bring him under suspicion* although no
     charge can be preferred against him in a moral point of
     view.

    <h2>
      DEPARTURE FROM GROTTKAU.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soon after receipt of the Decree of Suspension, I discontinued my official
      duties, but remained a few days longer in Grottkau, to take the necessary
      steps for clearing my character from the calumnies of Kaspar Hoffmann, and
      Ebel the apothecary and president of the body of delegates,* who had
      brought their silly accusations against me under cover of the Church. By
      the other inhabitants of the town I was most kindly treated, and the
      partially evasive testimonies which were afterwards given in by a <i>soi-disant</i>
      Church community of Grottkau, are only to be accounted for by the
      employment of Chapter influence. Various reports were, of course, in
      circulation, for but few were aware of the actual cause of my suspension,
      or of the manner in which I had been treated; and I was obliged to keep
      silence&mdash;to allow every report to circulate unchecked&mdash;deeply
      though I felt the altered looks of those I had accounted friends. But it
      would have been unreasonable in me to have expected of them a more
      thorough appreciation of the circumstances of my case, for no one knew how
      the slave-yoke of Rome had galled me, nor how my indignation was aroused
      to see my native land distracted and enthralled by a set of knavish Roman
      priests and their German assistants. I felt it as a joy and pride to
      suffer undeserved reproaches for my fellow-citizens, even for those who
      persecuted me, as they fancied, to the credit and in the name of the
      Church. I felt an assured confidence that the day of light would come, the
      day of emancipation from the tyranny of Rome, when my conduct should be
      made public, and my exculpation be complete; and I gave expression to
      these feelings in a few farewell words to the inhabitants of Grottkau,
      which I caused to be inserted in the weekly newspaper.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mr. Witke, the former superior of the Seminary, named Ebel
     (the brother-in-law of a canon, and a converted proselyte,)
     as my calumniator, and I can prove him to have been so. Such
     persons, who can consciously assume religion as a cloak for
     their false-heartedness, should be denounced by name to all
     the world. Our Saviour tells us that hypocrisy is the most
     heinous crime, and that murderers and adulterers may be
     saved, but not hypocrites!
</pre>
    <p>
      From Grottkau I travelled to Valtorf, near Neisse, where my friend the
      Count von Reichenbach offered me the shelter of his roof. Although I had
      relinquished certain competence, which the office of a Catholic clergyman
      secures, and knew not how long I might be a wanderer, yet the feeling that
      at length I had escaped from the cursed and ignominious yoke of Rome,
      under which I had groaned for three years, was indescribably delightful,
      and confiding in my righteous cause, and in my youthful strength, it
      seemed as if I had but just emerged from some dark, dismal prison, into
      the lovely light of heaven. New energy glowed in my veins; a new and
      beauteous world bloomed before me, in which I was to labour and to live as
      the free teacher, and the pastor of my own, the German people!

      MY SISTERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My joy was damped, however, and turned to sadness, when I thought upon the
      annoyances which my family, especially my four sisters, (our parents were
      dead) endured, owing to the numerous and often ill-natured reports that
      were spread regarding me. Homely country people, reared in the Catholic
      religion, young and inexperienced, they did not think the motives were
      sufficient, which led me to throw up my office. Although they placed
      unbounded confidence in me, it was doubtless somewhat shaken, when they
      found themselves disappointed in the prospect they had very properly
      indulged of future aid from me. They endeavoured, time after time, to
      prevail on me to resume my office, in consideration of the calumnies they
      had to bear. This has caused me hours of bitter sorrow.

    <h2>
      THE ANSWER OF THE COUNCIL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      About three weeks after the despatch of my Defence, and the testimonials
      from the magistrates, I received a negative reply from the right reverend
      Board.* In this reply no farther weight is given to the testimony of the
      magistrates of Grottkau, and the declaration of the inhabitants, than that
      they silenced the false accusations of Kaspar Hoffmann; and the
      representatives of Christian love and justice in the diocese of Breslau do
      not condescend to offer satisfaction for the annoyances to which I and
      mine had thereby been subjected. Although they might not consider
      themselves called upon to pay me a just debt, yet surely the united voice
      of an entire town was worthy of some little deference. But here we touch
      upon the second curse by which the hierarchy overlays the people. Even as
      the thraldom of the inferior clergy, in regard to their superiors,
      annihilates their manliness of character and self-respect, so the thraldom
      of the congregation in their relation to the clergy, keeps the great mass
      of the Catholic people in darkness and insensibility. That neither the
      congregations nor the inferior clergy have always been in this state of
      thraldom, is well known. It has been induced by their torpidity and
      ignorance. But had they never before enjoyed a state of greater freedom,
      the present times imperiously demand it.

      With my convictions, to have remained one moment longer in my office,
      after receiving the answer of the right reverend Board, would have
      dishonoured me. How could I have met my fellow-citizens, and spoken to
      them of the unfettered moral dignity of man, while I myself had sacrificed
      religious conviction in a pitiful and cowardly manner, for a bit of bread,
      secured to me by my condition as a Romish priest? This was my fixed
      determination:&mdash;rather the grave than dishonouring punishment&mdash;rather
      starvation than self-degradation, and injury of the rights of my
      fellow-citizens and colleagues! In order, however, that I might leave no
      method untried of obtaining justice, I wrote to the Council, stating that
      1 should appeal to the still unappointed bishop.

    <h2>
      AUDIENCE OF THE BISHOP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The confirmation of Bishop Knauer's appointment did at last take place; he
      was to enter Breslau in April 1843. I had gone to that town, partly to
      attend to my affairs, and partly to seek the means of future subsistence.
      After the the arrival of Bishop Knauer, I went to a Canon, whose name is
      appended to my Decree of Deposition, to ascertain at what time I might
      speak with the Bishop. This right reverend gentleman told me quite naively
      that I should have answered&mdash;"No, I am not the author of the article&mdash;bring
      it home to me!" with this addition, if I "desired to remain at my <i>clerical
      trade</i>." He further informed me, that although <i>he had not read the
      article in question</i>, it was said to contain terrible things.
    </p>
    <p>
      What say the younger clergy to the expression, <i>clerical trade!</i> and
      what shall one think of the justice and indepedence of a spiritual
      tribunal, whose members are not even aware of the nature of the crime for
      which they condemn their fellow-men! Justice! how, indeed, could I expect
      it at the hands of those who were at once my judges and accusers!
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the Bishop himself, when I preferred my complaint to him,
      essentially different from the greater number of the Catholic clergy. He
      received me in that winning manner, with which youth is easily fascinated
      by age. There was no trace in him of that <i>quasi</i> lowly spiritual
      pride, and vulgar affectation of pious condescension, so common in
      prelates. When I had made my request to him in few words, he replied, that
      the affair was not unknown to him, and that I only needed to apply to Dr.
      Ritter for a removal of the Suspension, to have the matter satisfactorily
      arranged. On my objecting, that I was of excitable temper, and that, under
      existing circumstances, I feared myself incapable of dealing calmly with
      that individual&mdash;he offered to hold a previous conference with Dr.
      Ritter. He then asked if I were the author of the article. I answered in
      the affirmative. "But why," continued he, "did you <i>invite</i> all this
      persecution?"&mdash;"Because," I answered, "it was my duty to give
      utterance to the unanimous feeling of the citizens and the clergy, seeing
      that no other priest considered himself called upon to do so." He said no
      more on this subject, but, speaking of the situation as tutor which I had
      accepted, he said that he needed my assistance in the diocese, and
      appointed that I should return to him in the afternoon. When I returned to
      the Bishop, he was embarrassed and reserved, in consequence of the
      conference with Dr. Ritter, who had inveighed against me in coarse
      language,* and asserted that I had been invited to appear before him and
      had not come (a falsehood! for surely condemnation is not invitation!). I
      proved, indeed, that Dr. Ritter had asserted an untruth; but Bishop
      Knauer, already eighty years of age, found it very inconvenient to quarrel
      with his canons, and excused himself by saying, that he had not so fully
      entered on the duties of his office as to qualify him as a competent
      judge. (This was on the day before his Inauguration.) Replying only by my
      looks, I took my leave, and set out for my new destination, Laurahütte, to
      engage in the teaching of the children of the functionaries of the place.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Among other things, Dr. Ritter asserted, as I was informed
     by Bishop Knauer, that I had been idling about for some time
     in Breslau without making my appearance at the Cathedral. A
     speaking instance of the noble nature of the right reverend
     gentleman! I had been staying all the time in the house of
     Mr. Wittig, a highly respected citizen, who had hospitably
     received me, and I had scarcely quitted it for an hour.

      LAURAHÜTTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lies near Beuthen in Upper Silesia, about half a mile from the Russian
      frontier. It is the most extensive foundry in Upper Silesia, and was only
      erected in 1839. It may easily be imagined that my spirits were not a
      little affected by the difficult circumstances in which I had been placed;
      for, besides seeing all my past labours brought to a fruitless
      termination, I had been compelled to submit in silence to all the attacks
      which had been made upon my character. Several of my Catholic friends had
      slighted me, or treated me unkindly; and the greater number of my Catholic
      fellow-citizens did not appear sufficiently to feel the oppressive yoke of
      Romish superstition.&mdash;The time had not yet come! My confidence had
      been severely tried by all these causes. I only clung the more closely,
      however, to my pupils at Laurahütte, and I often felt inclined to beg of
      them that they would not treat me so unkindly as other friends had done. I
      trembled if they left me for even half a day. I tried to find a resting
      place within their hearts, by building on their love. And truly, the
      brightest hours of my life have been passed in the school-room, cheered by
      their innocent and youthful hearts. My mind was gradually strengthened and
      refreshed, to which result the tender kindness of my friends at Laurahütte
      mightily conduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      I employed my hours of leisure in work connected with my avocation, and
      several performances were already completed, when the day of my release
      arrived, which I had been long expecting, and with increased impatience
      and assurance the nearer it approached. Our feelings oftentimes outrun all
      reason, and my confidence of ultimate release had been rising ever since I
      left the Seminary. The day at length arrived!&mdash;the 1st day of October
      1844. From the moment when I saw my article in print (I trembled lest it
      should be interdicted) I felt as if the month of May were come, and spring
      were budding in my Fatherland.

    <h2>
      THE LETTER TO THE BISHOP OP TREVES, AND THE CHAPTER OF BRESLAU.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The hope of ultimate emancipation from the yoke of Rome, to which I now
      look forward with confident assurance, was excited by the slaves and
      blinded servants of the Roman Hierarchy and of the Jesuits, on seeing the
      extremes to which they carried their mockery of religion and trial of the
      patience of the German people.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Tunic, of which they cannot even prove that it really was the tunic of
      Jesus Christ, is exhibited by these Baal-priests of avarice and greed, for
      public adoration; and the credulous multitude are not only allowed to
      offer homage to this garment, but are taught to hail it in these words:&mdash;"Holy
      garment, pray for us!" "Holy garment, I bow down before thee," &amp;c. For
      such mockery of religion, such frenzy, assumed as piety, at the bidding of
      the Church, language is inadequate to the expression of our indignation;
      and my letter to Bishop Arnoldi, condemned as all too strong, is childlike
      in comparison of the sacrilegious offence committed by the Church upon
      religion and the human understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, therefore, with unfeigned surprise that, in the beginning of
      November, after leaving Laurahütte (where a public school had been
      erected, and furnished, in the month of August, with two teachers) I
      received two written communications from the Chapter at Breslau, calling
      on me to retract what I had written, as offensive to that reverend body. I
      was less surprised when, after my refusal, I received the Decree of
      Excommunication.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered less that Dr. Ritter should demand a recantation of my article&mdash;"Rome
      and the Chapter of Breslau," it being far less dangerous to him to place a
      lie upon the altar, in regard to circumstances which <i>immediately after</i>
      Silesia alone, as the carrying out of his designs were likely, therefore,
      to attract but limited observation. But that an entire Chapter should
      venture, in the face of Europe, and even of the world, to countenance such
      undisguised abuse as that of the <i>adorable relic</i> at Treves&mdash;such
      an unheard-of money-trafficking in the most sacred matters&mdash;such an
      insane mockery of reason and the Gospel, was not only ecclesiastically
      impolitic, but revolting to all Christendom.*

     *  DECREE OF EXCOMMUNICATION, &amp;C.

     "Breslau, Oct. 29th 1844.

     "On the 30th of January of last year, the sentence of the
     Canonical Council was forwarded to you, whereby, in
     consequence of your failing satisfactorily to disprove the
     authorship of the Article 'Rome and the Chapter of Breslau,'
     and conducting yourself otherwise in a manner unbecoming a
     Catholic clergyman, you were deposed from the Curacy of
     Grottkau, and, having been interdicted from the performance
     of spiritual functions, were charged to submit yourself <i>ad
     exercitia spiritualia</i> in the Seminary here, under the
     orders of the Superior, and await the farther pleasure of
     the Council. You have hitherto paid no attention to this
     judgment, especially in regard to its later requirements,
     but have obstinately persisted in disobedience to your
     superiors.

     "There has lately appeared in No. 164 of the Vaterlands-
     blatter, another Article, dated Laurahütte, Oct. 1st, and
     bearing your signature, in regard to the exhibition of the
     Holy Tunic of Jesus Christ at Treves&mdash;an Article most
     offensive to all orthodox Catholics, and calculated
     seriously to injure the character of one of the most worthy
     bishops of the Catholic Church, and which, besides, contains
     an invitation to rebellion against all existing and
     universally recognized principles in the government of the
     said Church.

     "This calls for the strictest investigation, and excites
     well-deserved suspicion,&mdash;I therefore require of you, seeing
     that you subscribe yourself 'A Catholic Priest,' and call
     yourself a member of the Catholic Church in this diocese, to
     declare <i>within fourteen days</i>,

     "1st, Whether you acknowledge yourself the author of the
     above named Article;

     "2d, Whether, in case you do, you are inclined to atone for
     your offence, and the grief occasioned to the most reverend
     Bishop Arnoldi of Treves, by a solemn retractation in the
     same paper, and in other much-read Journals, to be named by
     me;

     "3d, Should you have had no part in the drawing out or
     despatching of said Article, and should your signature and
     address have been used without authority,&mdash;are you willing
     and able to prove it, and to free yourself from the
     suspicion which rests upon you, and in consequence of which
     you are hereby enjoined to present yourself without delay!

     "If the required explanation be not furnished within the
     time specified, and should you not show yourself ready to
     satisfy the questions put, I am reluctantly compelled, in
     addition to the Decree of Suspension, which has already been
     put in force, hereby to suspend over you the ecclesiastical
     punishment of degradation and excommunication."

     Diocese."

      Diocese.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the 18th and 19th of this month I received two letters of identical
      import; one addressed to me as a 'Catholic Priest,' the other as 'the late
      Curate,' in which I am required, before the lapse of fourteen days, to
      answer questions upon various points. To this requisition I reply in the
      following terms:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to the Article 'Rome and the Chapter of Breslau,' your Lordship
      observes, that I did not satisfactorily vindicate my conduct in regard to
      it. My reply to the inquisitorial queries of Dr. Ritter, must have been
      misunderstood, if it was considered in the light of a vindication. I have
      never endeavoured to vindicate myself in regard to that Article, nor have
      I ever denied its authorship;&mdash;but, on the other hand, I have never
      recognized the authority of Dr. Ritter, and the members of the right
      reverend Board, as at once my judges and my accusers in the matter. The
      inquisitorial questions which were then put to me, and the decision of the
      right reverend Board, by which, without citation, hearing, or defence,
      (accorded to the lowest criminal,) I was deposed, and condemned to
      dishonouring punishment in the Seminary, are, besides, an insult to the
      rights of the whole body of the inferior clergy. Shall not the lower
      clergy (like their fellow-citizens,) have the right to express an opinion
      opposed to that of their superiors, without perilling their existence? Are
      the truths of our religion so powerless, as to render necessary compulsion
      and coercion? Did Jesus found our Church upon such principles! Or, are the
      higher clergy the sole and infallible pillars of the truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      "The assertion, that I endeavoured to save my living by a falsehood,&mdash;by
      which it was attempted to bring upon me the contempt of my
      fellow-believers and fellow-citizens, I have practically disproved&mdash;having
      relinquished my office in the face of beggary and want&mdash;although I
      might easily have escaped Suspension by submission. Honour, truth, and
      justice, are of higher value in my eyes than the crumb of bread that
      nourishes my body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I acknowledged to Bishop Knauer, my lawful superior, that I am the author
      of the Article alluded to; upon which his Grace asked me,&mdash;&lt; But
      why did you thus court persecution?'&mdash;&lt; Because,' I said,' I
      considered it a duty to give public expression to the universal discontent
      prevailing in the diocese, on account of the delay of Rome.' Besides, 1
      shall not hesitate to vindicate my conduct in the eyes of my
      fellow-believers and my fellow-citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is farther asserted by your Lordship, that I conducted myself in
      Grottkau in an unbecoming manner. The offences included in this charge
      have been sufficiently refuted, as calumnious and false, by the
      magistrates and citizens of Grottkau; and I shall claim the protection of
      the State and of the public against such accusations. Or have our
      spiritual rulers, perhaps, the arbitrary privilege to blast my reputation
      at discretion?
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to the Article in regard to the exhibition of the so-called Holy Tunic
      at Treves, my name was plainly and distinctly affixed to it, and there has
      been no misuse in the matter. I only spoke the truth, and shall continue
      to do so without fear of men. I shall not hesitate to denounce abuses?
      even when they seek to hide themselves behind the altars of a thousand
      years. I have but done my duty in lending words to the almost universal
      indignation of my countrymen at the adoration of a piece of dress. It is
      truly marvellous that a high ecclesiastical authority should endeavour to
      defend so shameless an abuse. Is the abuse less blameable, because
      consecrated by a Bishop? What would have been said, had inferior members
      of the priesthood, or other Christians, sought to win fifty thousand
      dollars by the exhibition of that Holy Tunic 1 Did Christ, or the
      Apostles, do such things? Christ fed those who came to him&mdash;but did
      not rob them of their money; and He indignantly exclaimed in the Temple&mdash;'My
      father's house is a house of prayer&mdash;ye have made it a den of
      thieves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have spoken the truth, and shall never retract it, as is required of
      me. If, on this account, your Lordship should consider it your duty to
      degrade and excommunicate me&mdash;let it be so. I, for my part, am firmly
      convinced that the exalted Head of our religion numbers me among his
      disciples, notwithstanding; and I feel assured that my fellow-believers
      and my fellow-citizens will not exclude me from communion with them. For
      millions of men have heard my simple word, and they have gladly received
      it because convinced that it proceeded from an honest heart. Millions have
      loved me on account of it, and their love has not allowed itself to be
      deceived by the disgusting calumnies of embittered opponents. Their love
      will still support me. I can give no other reply.&mdash;I am, my Lord

    <h2>
      THE CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The history of my life is now before my countrymen, and they may judge
      between me and my opponents and traducers. I have given documentary proof,
      that, on account of the Article entitled "Rome and the Chapter of
      Breslau," I have been deposed, and sentenced to disgraceful punishment, by
      the Board of Canons, without citation, hearing, or defence, which are
      accorded to the most ordinary criminal. I have further proved, that, on
      account of the well-known letter to the Bishop of Treves, I have been
      excommunicated by the same right reverend Board&mdash;that is to say, I
      have been placed without the pale of the Church, as an irreclaimable
      sinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As, however, I have conducted myself, in speech and action, in accordance
      with my calling and my duty as a teacher, as also in agreement with the
      Gospel; and have, in defiance of law and justice, by unrighteous and
      despotic fiats of the Romish Church, been deposed and excommunicated&mdash;I
      appeal to the justice of my countrymen against the Hierarchy and its
      slaves, and demand that the members of the Canonical Board at Breslau be
      forced to rescind their sentence. I do not prefer this accusation in my
      own behalf alone, but stand forth in vindication of the rights of the
      whole body of inferior clergy, which are trampled upon by their superiors&mdash;in
      vindication of the rights of congregations, which are trampled upon by the
      entire priesthood! Lastly, I stand forth for Christendom, and, in the name
      of all Christendom, arraign the Romish Hierarchy, which falsely calls
      itself the "Universal Church," <i>because it does not fulfil, but directly
      opposes the Gospel call&mdash;the call to promote the perfect
      reconciliation of the family of man.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Romish Hierarchy has reduced the Gospel teaching to a system of usury,
      compulsion, and oppression, profanely&mdash;prostituted religion to a
      revolting Jesuitism,&mdash;and, instead of promoting the improvement and
      the reconciliation of mankind, maintains in all their bitterness the
      antipathies of nations, and, kindling civil war, (look to Switzerland and
      other countries!) debases human nature by hypocrisy and vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Roman Church which has to rend so wide asunder the yawning gulf
      which separates the higher from the lower classes, the ignorant from the
      educated, the poorer from the richer portions of all European nations; and
      it is she who is daily making that gulf still wider, by dint of Jesuitism
      and priestcraft. In order to escape from utter ruin, the overwhelming evil
      must be vigorously, resolutely met,&mdash;in compact phalanx. The nations&mdash;and
      above all the German nation&mdash;ought to call a free ecclesiastical
      convention, composed of laymen freely chosen, and of honest priests, to
      sweep away for ever all Jesuitism and priestcraft&mdash;to establish
      freedom of conscience on the ruins of hypocrisy&mdash;to purify religion,
      and to show the Church her actual calling, imposed upon her by the spirit
      of the times, and the exigencies of our people&mdash;namely, the
      reconcilement of the higher and the lower classes of humanity&mdash;the
      reconcilement of the nations and the peoples of the earth, by improving
      and ennobling them&mdash;by universal love and freedom. By our regard to
      our neighbour, we shew forth our love to God; for we are told by John,
      that "If a man say I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Arise, then, men of Germany and of France; men of Great Britain, Italy,
      and Spain, arise! Men of Europe and America! let us unite with our
      governments in the noble enterprise! To the work, like men&mdash;the work
      of peace and freedom! The hour is come! let us break the yoke of faith and
      conscience&mdash;drag down lying priesthood and the Hierarchy&mdash;annihilate
      disdainful Jesuitism, insulting God and man&mdash;and usher in the
      glorious reign of truth, and light, and righteousness&mdash;of virtue, of
      freedom, and of love! Let us usher in the true reign of Christ upon the
      earth!
    </p>
    <p>
      [This closes Ronge's Self-defence, which, in all probability, would never
      have seen the light, had it not been for the subsequent excitement caused
      by the affair of the Holy Coat. For however triumphant has been his
      exposure of the authorities with whom he has had to do, still such cases
      of arbitrary tyranny are far too common to excite more than a mere
      passing, or, at best, local interest. It required such a fact as that of
      Treves first to awaken a general interest, and thereby to secure a
      proportionate degree of attention to the details of such a personal
      narrative as we have now given. People desired to know about the history
      of the man who had brought home to their hearts and experience the abuses
      of the system which had hitherto ruled them as with a rod of iron. But
      especially as charges the most base and unfounded had been directed
      against Ronge, with regard to the real cause of his suspension, it became
      his duty to lay the whole facts before the public, and manfully to appeal
      to their sentence against that of the Church authorities of Breslau. We
      have inserted this Justification before noticing the movements which have
      taken place in consequence of the first letter, which, instead of
      appearing as a documentary part of the Justification, was inserted at a
      previous part of the narrative, and which gave its real personal and
      historical interest to his Self-defence.]

    <h2>
      OPINIONS, ADDRESSES, &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We must now return to the first letter, and notice the excitement created
      by it over the whole of Germany, Protestant and Catholic. The following
      appeared in the <i>Mannheim</i> Journal:&mdash;"The greatest attention has
      been lately directed to the admirable and pithy statement of a Catholic
      priest concerning the Holy Coat. It is peculiarly the citizen-class who
      have been electrified thereby. Not to have read it, (and it is impossible
      to escape the question)&mdash;is declared to be as bad as never having
      read anything. It is published in all the papers; and truly the spreading
      of truth and light in religious matters&mdash;and both it contains in rich
      measure&mdash;is not merely a matter of honour but of the heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Weimar</i>.&mdash;"There prevails here a complete frenzy to read the
      production of Ronge. A number of the citizens have caused it to be
      circulated <i>gratis</i> among the poorer inhabitants. For a very long
      period no production has created more sensation in the world,&mdash;and it
      is beyond doubt that Ronge's name will ever be distinguished in the
      history of the world and of the Church."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Westphalia</i>.&mdash;"The excitement which Ronge's letter has made
      among friend and foe becomes daily more conspicuous from the public press.
      In Magdeburg the whole middle class is against the ultra-montanist
      movement, and even the majority of the clergy,&mdash;as this movement
      throws all power into the hands of the bishops."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>West Prussia</i>.&mdash;"While the Jesuits are interdicting, by Church
      censures and prohibitions, the 'wandering Jew' of Eugene Sue, Ronge's
      letter is being circulated by the thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Kazbach</i>.&mdash;"John Ronge&mdash;a true German man&mdash;a true
      Christian minister, has openly shewn that the spirit of Christ is not yet
      dead in the Catholic Church of Silesia. His letter is quite invaluable.
      Each community has treasured it as a true legacy to posterity, to preserve
      Christianity from being perverted by the Hierarchy, and to shew that a
      Silesian priest had courage thus openly to proclaim the truth. And has not
      the whole of Germany welcomed the earnest words of the worthy man with
      hearty joy! In a short space, they have travelled through every German
      province, from the Oder to the Rhine. Thousands of Germans feel inspired
      by his name, and declare him one of the most valiant combatants against
      the dark powers of hierarchical tyranny."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ulm</i>.&mdash;"The Germans of the south are determined not to be
      behind their brethren in other parts of Germany."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are ordinary specimens of the extracts with which the German journals
      are filled, up to the present date. It is in truth impossible to take up
      any journal, Catholic or Protestant, which does not contain some
      announcement on the subject. Ronge's name is in every one's lips&mdash;his
      portrait is to be found in every print-shop, along with engravings, in all
      styles of art, of the Holy Coat. Addresses have been poured upon him from
      all quarters, expressive of gratitude, and sympathy, and admiration. Take
      the following specimen from the city of
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dantzic</i>:&mdash;"Highly Honoured Sir,&mdash;when more than 300 years
      ago the monk Luther declared war upon the Hierarchy, and introduced a new
      epoch into the history of the world, it could not but be that the man who
      declared 'I cannot do otherwise,' should be opposed, declared heretic, and
      persecuted. So shall it also be with you for your exposure of the
      Spectacle of the Holy Coat; in that letter which, through the press, has
      now been made the property of all. The enemies of the light shall not
      cease to calumniate and persecute you. As, moreover, the hearts of all
      lovers of the truth attached themselves to the monk Luther, and, as
      to-day, millions thank him for the light which surrounds them, so does the
      present generation with joy congratulate you, and future generations will
      preserve your memory in their thankful hearts, as of a man who, without
      human fear, declared the holy truth of God. Permit us, though we live far
      from you, to express to you, in name of all friends of the light, their
      most hearty thanks for the service which you have done by your open and
      noble opposition to the hierarchical spectacle of Treves. May the Almighty
      take you into his protection, and may his hand rest on you and bless you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dantzic, 16th November, 1844."
    </p>
    <p>
      This Address, and many of a similar nature, have been signed by
      Protestants and Catholics alike. Individual addresses also have been sent,
      signed exclusively by Catholics, and others signed exclusively by
      Protestants, as those from Leipsic and Berlin. Accounts from all parts of
      Germany are of a similar nature; even Bohemia, where the voice of Huss has
      long been silent, has come under the influence of the excitement,&mdash;Ronge's
      letter having crossed the frontier, and been circulated, no one could tell
      well how, by the thousand. It has now been translated into several of the
      languages of Europe, and it cannot admit of doubt, that on all hands the
      eyes of many are being opened by it, to see the awful bondage in which
      they and their fathers have so long been held.
    </p>
    <p>
      While all this was going on, it was not to be expected that the Catholic
      party should remain silent. Accordingly, they have been striving <i>per
      fas et nefas</i>, to arrest the movement, by calumniations of the author&mdash;by
      defences of their conduct&mdash;by appeals to the evils of the
      Reformation, and occasional significant references to the "powers that be"
      in the Vatican. It ought to be stated, that several of the Catholic
      clergy, before the appearance of Ronge's letter, had denounced the
      intended pilgrimage, manfully declaring, in opposition to all the sayings
      and doings of Arnoldi, and even the Bull of Leo X., that this was no
      matter of Catholic doctrine, and that it remained open for each individual
      Catholic to treat the evidence for or against the genuineness of the
      relic, as his private judgment and free inquiry might lead him. From such
      quarters, the movement of Ronge could not well be opposed; and it is
      striking, that wherever a priest has so expressed his opinion, but few,
      indeed, of his people went to Treves. Whether many of this class may join
      the movement remains to be seen, but it certainly seems highly probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ultra-Catholic party have expressed their opinions in two remarkable
      documents,&mdash;the one, An Address from the Clergy of Treves, and the
      other, from the Clergy of Breslau, with whom Ronge was connected, to
      Bishop Arnoldi. A few sentences will show the spirit of each. In the
      former it is stated, "that such scandalous Articles (as the publication of
      Ronge) must produce among all Catholics in Germany the greatest
      indignation, and shake to its foundation the peaceful relation of the two
      confessions; and this all the more, as before the ceremony alluded to,
      nothing had taken place to calumniate or asperse Protestant Christians.
      When, however, such a publication, by its tone and contents, alike
      unworthy of refutation, and calculated only to bring Catholics into
      contempt, is allowed to appear, by permission of the German Union or
      Prussia individually&mdash;this is a matter of deep sorrow to Catholics."
      After noticing the Constitution of Germany, in reference to religious
      matters, it proceeds,&mdash;"In so far as such calumnies are unattended
      to, is the rightfully guaranteed position of the German Catholics
      overthrown, and they are all the more called on to demand a guarantee, as
      many late events have shown but too clearly, that a section of the
      Protestants is disposed to maintain a hostile and intolerant position
      towards the Catholic Church, We, the Chapter of the Cathedral, accordingly
      pray that communications may be sent to his Majesty the King, and the
      German confederate States, to support the existing laws in opposition to
      what has taken place, to maintain the guaranteed rights of the Catholic
      Church, and to request the interference of the law against such abuses of
      the German press."

      Nothing could be more artful or cowardly than this document, as if the
      great settlement at the Reformation had been infringed by the open
      expression of opinion on what has excited the disgust and ridicule of all
      intelligent Catholics. It is not difficult to trace in the above letter
      the very spirit which, in a former age, would have found no obstruction in
      executing, after its own fashion, that law, to which now they are obliged
      to make a respectful and almost degrading appeal. Most fortunate is it
      that Ronge is the subject of a Protestant Government, which has it now in
      its power so materially to advance the cause of the Reformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now quote a portion of the address of the clergy of the Cathedral
      of Breslau. "Most worthy Lord Bishop! 'Troubles must come.' This saying of
      our Lord and Master has been confirmed so often in all ages, and
      especially in our times, that we need scarcely question that an Article in
      the <i>Sächsische Vaterlands-blätter</i>, from a Catholic priest, on the
      Holy Coat of Treves, should appear unexpected, amid the manifold
      experiences of your Grace. Nor do we believe that this scandal in Germany
      will at all affect the veneration in which your Grace is held, or cast the
      slightest shadow on your high and holy office. Taught and accustomed to
      suffer shame for the cause of the Lord, and comforted by the promise,
      'Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall
      say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake,' we would have
      passed by this calumny in silence, as a drop of the teeming ocean of
      blasphemies with which the Lord honours his Church, to see them dashed on
      its Eternal Bock,&mdash;if it had not come from the midst of us&mdash;from
      one who calls himself a Catholic priest. * * * The name of the blasphemer
      is <i>Ronge</i>, who was consecrated to the priesthood in Breslau. The
      spirit by which he has lately been actuated was not long in manifesting
      itself in him. An Article of similar stamp, calumniating his
      ecclesiastical superiors, and the supremacy of the Church, subjected him
      to an examination. Not being in a position to defend himself, and too
      haughty and hardened to seek forgiveness, by repentance and penance, he
      was obliged to give up his office, after the suspension of the Church had
      been pronounced against him. Since this period, Ronge has had nothing to
      do with the care of souls. What could be more welcome for the enemies of
      the Church, who looked with indignation on the crowds of pious pilgrims
      proceeding to the Cathedral of Treves, than that a pretended member of the
      Church&mdash;aye, a priest&mdash;should take the Holy Coat into his
      unclean hands, and tear it with logical power into pieces, while even his
      executioners left it from pious awe undivided. The holy ceremony is now at
      an end&mdash;the sacred shrine is closed&mdash;the holy relic, by the
      contemplation of which hundreds of thousands have been encouraged, and
      strengthened, and elevated, lies treasured up for future ages. The
      calumnies will be silenced&mdash;the blessings will remain, and when the
      holy treasure is again exposed to the worship of the believing multitudes,
      another race shall live and think in the pious prayers of those pilgrims
      who have completed their pilgrimage, and have attained from faith to
      sight. May this new race see better days&mdash;days of outward and inward
      peace&mdash;days of peace, which the world cannot give! May the pious
      bands who may then go on pilgrimage to Treves, attain the end of their
      undertaking, not amid the sneers of the scoffer, but amid the friendly
      congratulations of all, even of those who are connected with it! May the
      German people be then truly a people of brothers&mdash;one in that one
      thing which is needful&mdash;one in will, and deed, and faith, and
      struggles; and may the German fatherland, like the holy garment itself, be
      undivided! God grant you grace and strength for this great end!

      This document, like the preceding, is its own commentary. We leave our
      readers to weigh it along with the exposure made in Ronge's
      "Justification." It is not difficult now to see what influences have been
      at work in procuring its suppression, and it is deeply to be lamented,
      that a government so liberal as the Saxon, should have interfered in
      keeping back a statement so important, in the defence of truth and
      justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not deem it necessary to make long quotations from the ordinary
      Catholic journals on this part of the subject. They breathe the same
      spirit. Many of them are filled with appeals, of which a single sentence
      may suffice as a specimen:&mdash;"Laity and priesthood! have you already
      forgotten whither such proceedings lead? Know you not the causes and
      consequences of the Reformation? Will you lead the way to a second breach
      in the Church, as if the first had not been deplorable enough, both for
      the Church and country?" &amp;c. All of such extracts are proofs strong
      enough, how sensible all parties of Catholics are of the danger to be
      apprehended from Ronge's movement.

      THE NEW CHURCH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is now our duty to turn shortly to the positive results of this
      movement, <i>in the formation of a New Church, independent of all Papal
      connexion, and as such, calling itself not the Roman but German Catholic
      Church</i>. We have seen how Ronge had been excommunicated, and in what
      terms his former ecclesiastical superiors now spoke of him. Having been
      discarded by the Church, and no longer admitted to its ordinances, he set
      himself, without reserve, to the formation of a new Christian community.
      The first step towards this end was the publication of his second letter,
      addressed.

    <h2>
      TO THE INFERIOR CLERGY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Friends and former Colleagues.&mdash;Before writing these words to you, I
      asked myself&mdash;shall I be listened to by those to whom I am about to
      speak? or will my invitations strike in vain upon their ears? No, they
      will not strike in vain upon your ears&mdash;I feel it and I know it,
      friends and former colleagues! You, the so-called inferior clergy, have
      been hitherto but little, if at all addressed, because, although you
      constitute the real ground-work and the strength of the ecclesiastical
      body, you have been, and you still are held, to be a mass inaccessible to
      moral freedom&mdash;in fact, morally dead. But I have been compelled, by
      sense of duty and by love of my country, to address you; and besides, I
      speak to you at a time when the laity themselves&mdash;the congregations&mdash;think
      and act, not according to the dead letter, but in agreement with the
      spirit of religion. Can it then be, that you, the priests&mdash;the
      teachers of the people, unlike them, can choose supinely to remain in
      circumstances of blind surrender of your judgment? Can you alone, and
      without exception, be so deeply sunk in slavery to Rome and the deadness
      of the letter, that it is no longer possible for you to arise and shake
      your spirits free! This I neither can nor will believe, for this were to
      believe you had forgotten to be men&mdash;it were to doubt the triumph of
      the kingdom of Christ&mdash;the triumph of righteousness,&mdash;it were to
      doubt the improvement and the advancement of society, which you are
      imperatively called on to promote. Oh, I have better thoughts of you, for
      I have suffered, and still suffer with you; I know the giant-yoke you
      wear, and to wear which is accounted (to you?) as the fulfilment of a most
      sacred duty&mdash;as a merit&mdash;as <i>religion</i>. Many a one of you
      has lamented to me, that the pain of blinded, passive slavery to Rome
      burned incurably in his bosom, and I know how many among you writhe in
      desperation, and await with longing the hour that is to set you free. It
      is, therefore, upon you, and the triumphant strength of a righteous cause,
      that I ground my confidence of an assured result. I know full well that
      you will not all, of one accord, and at my earliest word, strike off the
      shameful fetters of the Roman despotism, and stand forth as independent
      German priests&mdash;although each one must feel that there is inspiration
      in the very thought&mdash;but I entertain the hope that many a one may be
      aroused from stupefaction at my call&mdash;that many a timid one may be
      encouraged, and many a dazzled eye restored to clearer vision&mdash;that
      many among you, moved by my example, will dare to cast a bold and fearless
      glance within, and having done so, with a cry of grief&mdash;a cry of
      horror, at your condition, to stride forward to the contest, which is to
      make you once more men! It is to that that I invite you; you must become
      men&mdash;independent men, for the sake of our holy religion, for your own
      sakes, and for the happiness of our common Fatherland,&mdash;I invoke your
      manhood! You must become men, filled with a sense of your great dignity as
      such, as well as with the importance of your mission&mdash;glowing with
      active zeal for the spiritual and moral elevation of the nations of the
      earth! you must become men full of love to your calling&mdash;burning to
      secure the happiness of your fellow-mortals!&mdash;men full of holy ardour
      to establish the rights of all your fellow-citizens without distinction&mdash;full
      of holy ardour for the bringing in of the reign of righteousness and
      brotherly-love among all the children of men; men full of ardour to
      exhibit your convictions in your actions&mdash;to turn your words to truth
      and actual realization, that all men may become brothers&mdash;as the
      children of one Father. In obedience to your calling, you must become such
      men. But you are not so at present&mdash;you are the hirelings of the
      Pope! Yes, you are hirelings, without a feeling of your dignity as men, or
      of the importance of your mission, although you call yourselves the
      chosen, honoured, and consecrated servants of the Lord! You do not glow
      with zeal for the honour, the moral freedom, the welfare of your
      fellow-citizens; you even grind down the bourgeoisie and peasantry, who
      number in their ranks your parents and their families&mdash;by whose sweat
      you are supported,&mdash;and anathematize them when they raise their
      heads, impatient of Romish interference with their consciences. You feast,
      while they are hungry; you riot, while they pine! Is this falsehood? See
      here a bishop with 40,000 annual dollars (£6000)&mdash;religious
      institutions with incalculable wealth, and not far from them a poor
      weaver, who can barely earn five silver groschens (6d.) weekly for himself
      and for his family! You are not filled with holy ardour to spread abroad
      righteousness, truth, and light&mdash;although from desk and pulpit you
      deceitfully proclaim, 'with us alone are truth, peace, civilization,
      education, and moral freedom; we are the trusty friends and guides of the
      nations; it is to us men must commit their faith, in order after earthly
      toil to become blessed!' Far rather do many of you labour, some
      consciously, others unconsciously, to promulgate superstition, darkness,
      and spiritual bondage! You will say to me,&mdash;'Bring proof, bring
      proof,' and proof you shall have, an hundred-thousand fold:&mdash;<i>the
      fruits of your words and of your actions!</i> Look to your own consecrated
      class&mdash;what <i>corruption!</i> Look to the nations&mdash;what <i>misery!</i>
      'A good tree cannot bear evil fruit.'' The corruption of your consecrated
      order is the fruit of your soul-killing servitude to your superiors; the
      misery of the nations is, for the most part, the result of your
      oppression. The pressure under which you yourselves languish, is fearful
      and unspeakable, for you have been robbed of freedom in the exercise of
      reason, will, and affection. You are slaves&mdash;and therefore wish your
      fellow-citizens to share your bondage. Your spirit lies enchained by
      despotic bulls and edicts&mdash;the unfettered flight of thought is
      restrained by curses. Your reason is the venal slave of selfishness and
      terror. The so-called Romish Church&mdash;more properly Rome's <i>despotism</i>,
      has placed your faith within such narrow bounds that you are forced to
      tremble at each rising thought, and ask if it be 'orthodox?'&mdash;for
      these bounds of faith are beset by fiends who threaten your salvation when
      your spirit thinks to over-step them. Is it not so? Does not the fear of
      devils and of hell exert a widely greater influence than the love of God
      and of your fellow-men? And what absurdities are you not commanded to
      believe and teach!
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have, further, been deprived of your <i>free agency</i>. You must
      yield blind obedience to your superiors, and this requirement of passive,
      blind obedience is the prime injunction of the Roman Church! Without this
      blind obedience, all your virtues are of no avail&mdash;without it you are
      criminals. The Roman Church, that kindly mother, has seized your rights as
      men; you have not, as my example may convince you, even such privileges as
      are accorded to the worst of criminals in your fatherland. And of whom is
      this Church composed? You tremble before her and her edicts? Do you know
      that it is before yourselves you tremble? for you no less belong to the
      Church than those among your colleagues who sit in the chapter-houses or
      in the episcopal seats&mdash;no less than that Italian Bishop who is
      called the Pope! Have you forgotten that your colleagues, to whom you are
      now required to offer almost idolatrous regard, neither were, nor wished
      to be, above yourselves in the early centuries of Christianity? Have you
      forgotten that the bishops and priests of those days were chosen from
      among the congregations,&mdash;that is, the people; and that the people
      sat in council with them both! The inferior clergy had their synods even
      in the gloomy centuries of the middle ages, and, when they acted in
      concert, could give due weight to their desires. And what have you now, in
      the nineteenth century? Lordly Presbyterial Assemblies?! Each one among
      you fears to utter an honest word in presence of a right reverend brother.
      You are mere automata. You have no will in opposition to your superiors.
      <i>Demand your rights as men!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your <i>freedom of affection</i> also has been destroyed; your heart is
      stifled and perverted. And how! Shall I hesitate freely to speak out,
      because I may subject myself to suspicion&mdash;because I expose myself to
      the attacks of vulgar-minded men? Ah, no! the principle at stake is too
      important, too elevated, and too holy,&mdash;it involves nature's highest
      ordinance, the holiest concerns of man; from it depends the happiness, the
      welfare of many millions&mdash;the virtue, honour, and freedom of the
      nations; so that I would gladly expose myself on its account to suspicion
      and attack! It is <i>love, marriage, and the family-tie</i>; you have been
      robbed of these&mdash;robbed of them by the Rule of Celibacy! It is by
      this Rule that your affections are stifled and perverted. Yes, your hearts
      are corrupted by the ordinance of celibacy, which has no warrant in the
      Gospel, but has been introduced with blood and murder by an imperious
      Pope. This ordinance deprives you of your claim to the possession of a
      virtuous wife, whose love would render you far happier and more
      honourable; it robs you of the joys, the hopes, the love, which bless the
      family-tie; it impoverishes and desolates your breast. This ordinance
      demoralizes your natural instinct, hands you over to those outcasts of
      womankind, through whom so many fall into the deepest mire of immorality,
      and become an offence and mockery to their congregations. This ordinance
      deprives you of the stamp of open manliness, and makes you <i>hypocrites!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the free exercise of reason, will, and affection, has been taken from
      you, what have you left worth living for? Can your luxurious tables
      compensate for the loss of life's best blessings? Compensate! when your
      feast is interrupted by the needy, wretched cries of thousands of your
      starving fellow-creatures! or are your revels only seasoned by the groans
      of your necessitous brethren? You call yourselves the fathers, the
      teachers of the people; arise, then! conduct yourselves as such, and help
      to extricate them from their depth of spiritual and physical misery! Such
      is your duty, before all others!&mdash;'But how can we help them,' do you
      ask? Not by the bit of silver, thrown to the poor man with an ostentatious
      air, which, in most instances, but tends to lower or extinguish
      self-respect; and is besides, but as a drop in the great furnace. Stand
      forth against the despotism of Rome! abolish superstition, that barrier to
      free agency, and the free practice of virtue! break down the dishonouring
      restrictions upon conscience and religion! contend for the spiritual and
      physical wellbeing of your fellow-citizens, and you will aid the people
      and yourselves! Yes, arise and burst the chains of cowardice and shame;
      tear asunder the web of dissimulation which Rome has woven round you, and
      become unfettered, honest priests&mdash;true teachers of the German
      people! You will become everything! for at present you are <i>nothing</i>;
      become <i>men!</i> attain at last to the conviction, that the priests
      exist for the people, and not the people for the priests; that Christ
      established his religion, and enjoined brotherly love, that mankind might
      be rendered holy and happy even while on earth; and that it is not his
      wish that they should pine in soul and body here, in order to be saved at
      last, as Romish despotism teaches;&mdash;dare to achieve this conviction,
      and act upon it, as in duty bound! Cast off the silly bigotry with which
      Rome knows how to inoculate you, and live and labour, not for Rome's
      Bishop and her ambitious prelates, but with and for your fellow-citizens!

      "Seek rather to attain an honourable place among your fellow-citizens, and
      their respect and love&mdash;by activity, unblemished character, and a
      virtuous&mdash;life, than to way-lay or supplicate an indolent and hateful
      benefice. Scorn at length that slave-like prejudice, which would rather
      follow in the worshipful footprint of its right reverend master, than
      listen to the unbiassed judgment and opinion of a freeman! Venture to
      contend for your own and the peopled independence and moral freedom&mdash;you
      will be cordially supported by your fellow-citizens! Employ the pulpit,
      the confessional,* and the teacher's desk, which long have been abused for
      the darkening and degrading of your countrymen&mdash;for their improvement
      and emancipation! With and by the people you may become independent!
      Assist, therefore, first of all, in emancipating the national schools, and
      in securing for the community the free choice of pastors, and keep abreast
      of the spirit of the people and of the times. Yes, yes! go hand in hand

      bands of freebooters of the Romish Hierarchy, wring from the poor by means
      of Rosary and Prayer-associations, and of which they rob the rich by
      mortmain. When our people shall have learned this&mdash;when they shall
      have discovered how fearfully all that they hold most sacred&mdash;their
      religion&mdash;is abused by the Romish Church, they will cast off Rome and
      her hypocrites with inexorable indignation. Still you may object,&mdash;'A
      great portion of our people is more attached than ever to the formal

      ever to places of Pilgrimage and Indulgence, and these processions are not
      confined to the ignorant populace, but are joined by educated wives and
      maidens, while the younger clergy are full of fanaticism! Does not this
      indicate the increase and the triumph of the Romish Creed?' Such phenomena
      there are indeed&mdash;phenomena belonging to the sixteenth, not the
      nineteenth century&mdash;but these phenomena are the curse upon your
      cowardice, the consequences of a want of moral courage to contend against

      have not dared to sacrifice your benefices to your heart's convictions, to
      the welfare of your congregations&mdash;of the nation! The slaves of Rome

      have been at liberty to proclaim the grossest abuses as the actual
      substance of Christianity, announcing follies and absurdities as Christian
      truths&mdash;for it is but seldom that any one, now and then, has ventured
      to raise his voice against them, or at least it has been speedily reduced
      to silence when once raised.

      declare Himself to you&mdash;you shall hear Him in the voice, in the call
      of your people, of your native country! The nation calls you now to a
      great and holy work. 'You must,' such is its call, 'cast off the degrading
      and unchristian despotism of the Roman Bishop; you must, in union with
      your fellow-citizens, the laity, restore, without fear of men, the
      Christian-Catholic religion, in all its purity and simple elevation; you
      must establish a German-Catholic (i. e. universal) Christian Church; you
      must be no longer Romish, but honest German priests and teachers. Such is
      the voice of your people,&mdash;the call of your country! Will you obey
      the call? Will you begin the work without fear of men? Oh, I entreat you,
      I conjure you to obey the call; go promptly to the work, now, while there
      yet is time! I beg of you to set to the work, and I am not ashamed to beg,&mdash;the
      boon is so elevated and important! I implore you in the name of our
      religion, for the sake of honour, independence, and the peace of Germany,&mdash;I
      implore you, for your own sakes, by your dignity, honour, virtue,&mdash;by
      your happiness as men!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of you will object&mdash;'But then we must cast off the Pope, and
      that were contrary to the Gospel; for Christ says to Peter,&mdash;"Thou
      art a rock, and upon thee will I build my Church;" Peter was Bishop of
      Rome, and the Pope is his successor!' What, brethren? Do you interpret the
      saying of the elevated founder of our religion according to the deadness
      of the letter? Are you not aware that Christ based His Church upon the
      faith and love of Peter, and of his other disciples and followers, but not
      upon his person? Do you not know that Rome has spared, and spares, no
      fraud to aggrandize herself, and that as history informs us, her prelates
      and her slaves have availed themselves of any means, however inadmissible,
      for the attainment of the self-same end? Do you not know that power and
      riches are the chief objects of the Court of Rome! and, therefore, must no
      Catholic either think or speak freely on religious matters, but blindly,
      like an animal, embrace and act upon the opinions of his priest! Ah! you
      know all this and more;&mdash;you know that you even act in direct
      opposition to the religion of Christ in bringing mankind under the
      unworthy dominion of the Pope, and in the degrading of your
      fellow-citizens; but you want the moral courage to shake yourselves free,
      you fear to lose your livelihood, you shrink from want and labour! Such
      fear is unworthy of the disciples of Christ and of the Truth. As such, you
      ought to fear nothing so much as the degradation of yourselves and of your
      fellow-men, to which the Papal yoke constrains you; and it is, therefore,
      your most sacred duty to renounce the Pope, and to become the true priests
      of your people. Or are you, perhaps, not in a condition to promote the
      welfare and prosperity of your fellow-citizens? Do you require the aid of
      a distant Italian Bishop,&mdash;of a foreign power? You are better able to
      promote it than a distant Italian Bishop can be! Do you fear that the
      renunciation of Rome would lead to discord! Certainly not; for we are men,
      and we will act like men! With manly energy and discretion, in union with
      our fellow-citizens, will we call together the communities, freely to
      deliberate and determine what steps are needful for us all. In such a work
      there is no room for discord, for all violence is done away. Discord and
      violence are occasioned only by the Romish despotism, which knows no other
      law than its own advantage and aggrandizement. The Romish Hierarchy repels
      that German maiden from the altar, who gives her heart to one who owns a
      different creed,&mdash;profanes the virgin modesty of our sisters by
      wanton questions under the cloak of religion,&mdash;takes upon itself,
      here in the midst of Germany, to refuse the sacraments to mothers, if
      their children be not nurtured in the faith of Rome,&mdash;rages against
      all attempts at reconciliation between German Catholics and Protestants,&mdash;it
      is the Romish Church that will not hear of peace, however longed for by
      the people!
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Romish Government has likewise brought us under an unchristian
      constraint, and introduced abuses into our religion, which lead to
      superstition and to vice, and which deprive us of the blessings of the
      Christian doctrine. We must first of all sweep away these abuses, we must
      dismiss, as unintelligible to our people, from all the houses of God in
      Germany, the Latin language,&mdash;that monument of our subserviency and
      spiritual bondage, that unholy constraint which outrages the clearest
      injunctions of the Gospel; for Paul says, (1st Cor. 14, 19,) 'I had rather
      speak five words with my understanding, than ten thousand words in an
      unknown tongue,' and in the 23d verse he justly and directly denounces as
      madness the use of a foreign and unknown language. We must besides abolish
      the confessional, that moral torture-chamber, that degrading tribunal of
      Inquisition,&mdash;which stamps men hypocrites and blinded slaves to
      priestcraft,&mdash;which expels from the Supper of the Lord so many
      thousand Catholics who nevertheless feel themselves invited,&mdash;and
      which without a warrant in the Gospel, was first introduced by one of the
      most power-loving Popes, twelve hundred years after Jesus Christ. We must
      abolish all those mischievous contrivances of Rome, which are only
      intended for the extortion of money,&mdash;which undermine true piety, and
      degrade the priest to a farmer and a trafficker in salvation! The pure and
      true and Catholic Christian religion, shall alone remain, and its
      fundamental law&mdash;the law of love,&mdash;shall not only be expressed
      in words, but practically evidenced in our dealings with all our
      fellow-men of every faith and creed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been constrained, my friends, to address you in these few words,
      to which I have felt myself called by a sense of the duty imposed on me as
      preacher of religion, as a disciple of the truth,&mdash;these words,
      dictated by love to my fellow-citizens, and anxiety for their salvation,
      honor, and welfare,&mdash;and love to yourselves who languish under the
      yoke of Rome! It depends now upon yourselves whether you will obey the
      call of your religion, and of your fellow-citizens, and your improved
      convictions. Woe! woe! to you, who hear not this appeal! and rest in error
      and hypocrisy!&mdash;the righteous indignation of your countrymen, who are
      now awaking to consciousness, will condemn you in a voice of thunder, and
      the sentence will be indelibly engraved upon the page of history! The
      work, besides, will be achieved without you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you, who obey this call, eternal joy and blessing! You, who armed with
      the moral courage of your calling, shun no labour and no sacrifice! Yes,
      eternal joy and blessing to you! Your own consciences will reward you, the
      love of your countrymen, the enduring gratitude of history, shall secure
      you a millennial fame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In this letter, as in the former, it is easy to trace the same spirit
      which so evidently characterizes the author as an honest and fearless
      assertor of what he believes to be the truth. The event soon shewed that
      he had not to fight single-handed. Previously, he had received assurances
      of the sympathies of thousands; and now, when the period for action came,
      there were not wanting many to cast in their lot with him, as
      fellow-workers in overturning the great system of idolatrous worship. When
      first suspended, his whole flock petitioned that his services might still
      be continued to them&mdash;the best practical reply to the charges
      advanced against him. Several secessions speedily took place;
      congregations were formed at <i>Schneidemühl</i>, under pastor <i>Czerski</i>,
      and at Breslau, where Ronge now is occupied with the constitution and
      settlement of the new community. In most cases, the ultra-Catholic party
      have done what they could to create disturbance in the meetings, and
      generally to obstruct the progress of business; but such attempts have
      proved ineffectual. Of course, much in the constitution of the Church must
      for a long time remain incomplete, but great unity, as well as zeal, has
      hitherto characterized their proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal places where congregations are being formed are Breslau,
      Schneidemühl, Leipsic, Dresden, Berlin, Magdeburg, Halberstadt, Offenbach,
      Brunswick, Coblentz, Worms, and even Cologne, where priestly influence is
      at its <i>maximum</i>. Other places it would be useless to name; in fact,
      accounts have been received from a vast number of quarters; but definite
      and final steps have not yet been taken, and, on all hands, it is found to
      be the ease, that great numbers, including clergy as well as laity, desire
      the formal recognition of the Church by the State, before they openly avow
      their separation from the Roman See. The documents connected with the
      origin, constitution, and principles of the Church have now been laid
      before the Prussian Government; but, while we write, no final answer has
      been returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following remarks will so far explain the relation of this Government
      to the new movement:&mdash;Hitherto they have maintained the position of
      strict neutrality. The law of the land guarantees full freedom of
      conscience to every Prussian citizen; and as the new doctrines involve no
      principles of danger to the common safety, their defenders are entitled to
      demand that no police restrictions be put in the way of their progress.
      The law draws a distinction between religious societies merely <i>tolerated</i>,
      and those formally <i>acknowledged</i> by the State; the latter only
      having corporate rights and privileges. The two Protestant Churches&mdash;the
      Reformed and Lutheran&mdash;have been united into one Church, generally
      called the Evangelical, which, with the Catholic, have alike the full
      sanctions of State protection. It is manifest, that where such strenuous
      efforts have been made to bring about this singular union, and where <i>unity
      of creed</i> is the avowed object of the Government, the sanctioning a new
      class of separatists, whether from the Catholic or Protestant Church,
      might lead to serious political consequences. The party of the <i>Old
      Lutherans</i>, who refused to co-operate in the scheme of union, have,
      strictly speaking, no legal standing in the constitution of Prussia. They
      are tolerated, but not acknowledged by the State. It seems exceedingly
      probable that such will be the position of the new German Catholic Church,
      which would at once secure the legally guaranteed rights of conscience,
      and, at the same time, form no exception to the determination of the
      Government, as such, to have only the two great antagonist Churches and
      Confessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the King of Saxony, though a Catholic, has more openly avowed
      his principles in connection with the movement. He was waited on by the
      Bishop and Catholic Clergy of Leipsic, for the purpose of impressing on
      him the duty of putting down the new sect by law. His reply was as
      follows:&mdash;"I wonder much at the demand you have made; and all the
      more, as you know that nineteen-twentieths of my subjects are Protestants,
      whose conduct of late to my Catholic fellow-citizens has greatly rejoiced
      my heart. You know, moreover, that I am King of a <i>constitutional State</i>,
      and, as such, have promised and sworn to secure full religious freedom to
      my subjects, of whatever faith. I shall, then, place no obstruction in the
      way of what has taken place, but give events their free course, because <i>I
      will not, and dare not</i>, make any one swerve from that faith and
      worship from which alone he expects salvation. This is my firmly-settled
      resolution." And with these memorable words, the Bishop and Clergy were
      most graciously dismissed. The joy in Leipsic at the answer of the King
      was unbounded, As an off-set to this state of matters in Prussia and
      Saxony, we have to state, that the papal influence has been brought to
      bear upon the Governments of Austria and Bavaria&mdash;we believe with
      success&mdash;to prevent <i>by law</i> the formation of any Church in
      connection with the new sect, throughout both kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, of course, not to be expected that these congregations can as yet
      have had time or opportunity to draw up a full and duly authorized
      Confession of Faith. As matters stand, one congregation has adhered to the
      Apostolical Creed&mdash;another to the Nicene Creed (a.d. 325). The
      following is the Confession drawn up, and which has been generally adhered
      to by the congregation of Schneidemühl:&mdash;

    <h2>
      CONFESSION OF FAITH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Art. 1. The foundation of the Christian faith should be solely and
      exclusively the Holy Scriptures and Reason, pervaded and actuated by true
      Christian principles in their interpretation&mdash;Art. 2. The community
      accepts the Apostolic Creed as its own. It is the problem of the Church,
      as of the individual, to reduce its contents to a living recognition,
      corresponding with the principles of the age.&mdash;Art. 3. In the
      difference of statement and interpretation with regard to the given
      contents of this Confession of Faith, the community finds no ground for
      excommunication or anathematizing.&mdash;Art. 4. With reference to the
      objective principles of belief, it, is held that there ought to be no
      impediment to free inquiry, and that no one should be anathematized on
      account of the exercise of the right conceded to him of free inquiry&mdash;because
      it is impossible to fix a completely definite rule of faith for the human
      mind.&mdash;Art. 5. The community consider the chief problem of
      Christianity to be, not merely the bringing of its principles to living
      recognition among the members of the community, by public worship,
      teaching, and instruction, but also the promoting, according to their
      ability, the spiritual, moral, and physical good of their fellow-men,
      without distinction.&mdash;Art. 6. The community acknowledges only two
      Sacraments, Baptism and the Lord's Supper; because only these have
      unquestionably been instituted by Christ, according to the testimony of
      the Scriptures.&mdash;Art. 7. Baptism is the sign of reception into the
      Christian Society; it is administered to children under the reservation of
      their confirming the Confession of Faith at the years of maturity.&mdash;Art.
      8. The Lord's Supper serves as a remembrance of Christ, and as a sign of a
      covenant of brotherhood for all men.&mdash;Art. 9. The Sacrament to be
      received by the community in both kinds, as it was appointed by Christ.&mdash;Art.
      10. Transubstantiation is not acknowledged, because it cannot be justified
      from the Gospel.&mdash;Art. 11. Marriage is declared as a holy
      institution, and the blessing of the Church on the same regarded as
      necessary.&mdash;Art. 12. There are no other restrictions on marriage
      recognized than those appointed by the laws of the State.&mdash;Art. 13.
      Celibacy is rejected by the community as an institution not found in the
      Holy Scripures, as not to be justified before reason, and as devised by
      the Roman Popes for the advancement of their Hierarchy.&mdash;Art. 14. The
      community rejects the supremacy of the Roman Pope.&mdash;Art. 15. It
      abolishes auricular confession.&mdash;Art. 16. It uses the language of the
      people in public worship.&mdash;Art. 17. It rejects the invocation and
      worshipping of saints, (admitted into the ritual of the Romish Church),
      relics, and images, which are regarded as unchristian, and as leading to
      gross abuse.&mdash;Art. 18. All the previously existing customs of the
      Church, such as indulgences, fastings, pilgrimages, which could only lead
      to a useless work-holiness, are abolished by the community.&mdash;Art. 19.
      The outward form of public worship should ever adapt itself to the wants
      of time and place.&mdash;Art. 20. The outward demeanour in the Church
      cannot be prescribed, and is left to the religious sense of each
      individual; that which leads to superstitution is forbidden.&mdash;Art.
      21. Only those festivals are to be celebrated which are sanctioned
      according to the laws of the land.&mdash;Art. 22. The community makes use
      of its old right freely to elect for itself its pastors and
      office-bearers.&mdash;Art. 23. The community is to be represented by its
      pastors and the chosen elders; the election of the elders to take place
      yearly at Whitsunday.&mdash;Art. 24. Each pastor to be introduced to the
      congregation and to his office by a church service, yet herewith avoiding
      everything which could be held as sanctioning the sacramental value of the
      Roman consecration of the priesthood, and serve as the foundation of the
      Hierarchy.&mdash;Art. 25. The stipend of the pastor to be regulated
      according to the means of the members of the congregation.&mdash;Art. 26.
      All church transactions, such as baptisms, marriages, burials, to be gone
      about by the pastor, without (surplice) fees, for all members of the
      community alike.&mdash;Art. 27. All these findings are not settled for all
      times, but can be altered according to the belief (lit. consciousness) of
      a particular period, by the community in agreement therewith.&mdash;Art.
      28. To make a Christian Church a truly universal (Catholic) one, and not
      to exclude the admission of congregations constituting themselves in
      different places&mdash;all these, in every view, merely provisional
      findings, to be submitted to a universal (German) council,&mdash;Art. 29.
      The reception into the Church, after its complete constitution, takes
      place after the declaration of desire for admission, and the acceptance of
      the Confession of Faith adopted by the community, before the
      office-bearers, by public deed in the congregation.

    <p>
      Another short document has appeared, which runs as follows:&mdash;"I
      believe in God the Father, who by his Almighty Word created the world, and
      governs it in wisdom, justice, and love. I believe in Jesus Christ, one
      Saviour, who by his teaching, his life, and his death, has redeemed us
      from the bondage of sin. I believe in the work of the Holy Spirit upon
      earth&mdash;a holy universal Christian Church&mdash;the forgiveness of
      sins, and the life everlasting. Amen."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is the order of Church-service for the Church in Breslau.&mdash;1.
      Introductory Hymn. 2. Confession of sins (Confiteor). Lord pity us, &amp;c.
      Glory be to God, &amp;c. 4. The prayers of the Collect. 5. The Epistle. 6.
      The Gospel. 7. The Sermon, with the usual prayers, with a verse of a hymn
      before and after. 8. Instead of the Canon of the Mass, a passage from the
      Passion and the Sacrament. 9. Holy, holy, holy, &amp;c. O, Lamb of God,
      &amp;c. 10. Lord's Prayer. 11. Concluding Hymn. 12. Benediction. It has
      also been resolved that part of the Sabbath afternoon be devoted to
      catechizing, as is now common in many Protestant churches in Germany and
      Switzerland. The only point of difference, so far as we are aware, among
      the different communities, is on the doctrine of tradition; some proposing
      to abolish it altogether, while others wish to retain it so far as in
      accordance with the Bible&mdash;though to maintain a subordinate place. An
      intimation has been published, stating that representatives from all the
      churches&mdash;now about 18 in number&mdash;are to meet in Leipsic at
      Easter, to make arrangements for the authorized constitution of the new
      Church. Meanwhile Ronge has prepared the draft of a new liturgy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The community at <i>Elberfeld</i>, in separating from the Church of Rome,
      expresses itself as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the name of God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen! We,
      the undersigned citizens of Elber-feld, belonged, up to this period, to
      the Roman Catholic Church, and had, for a long period, been aware with
      increasing force, of the errors and abuses which cling to it in its most
      inward principles, and have assumed the ascendancy in its latest phases.
      The more we have striven to become acquainted with the true doctrine of
      Jesus in the Gospel, which is the alone source of revealed truth, the more
      deeply have we been penetrated with the conviction, that Christ is the
      only mediator between God and man, and that the doctrine with regard to
      the Pope and the one infallible Church, has no foundation in the word of
      God, and weakens the merits of Christ; that the doctrines of the Romish
      Church of the Holy Sacrament&mdash;of the priesthood and its relation to
      the people, is false, and deprives believers of their choicest privileges.
      The more clear this conviction has gradually grown upon us, the more
      oppressive do we feel the chains by which we are bound, and the more are
      we in our consciences hindered from belonging to a Church whose most
      important doctrines we can no longer reconcile with the Gospel, from
      adhering to a faith which we cannot openly avow as becomes the disciples
      of the Lord. Herewith was connected the pain of having no worship of God
      corresponding with our altered religious views. Then came forth from the
      darkness, whose shadows settled more and more thickly over us, a light
      which, in our extremity, we view as the morning-dawn of hope, and as
      announcing to us the good favour of God. Events, to which we do not
      require more specially to refer, have given us the joyful assurance, that
      the day is at hand, which brings deliverance and freedom to those in
      bondage! That which was struggling unconsciously within ourselves has now
      been brought to full consciousness, and we thank God that we now know what
      we should do, and that he has given us courage openly to bear testimony to
      the faith which we acknowledge. In the sight of God we separate ourselves
      from the Pope, and the Hierarchy, and from the whole anti-evangelical
      system therewith connected, whatever struggles or shame we may have to
      encounter. We thus separate ourselves&mdash;not for the sake of carrying
      on a war against those who hold a different confession&mdash;not even that
      confession which we abandon&mdash;but for the purpose of finding rest for
      our souls, and of serving and thanking our God and Lord in peace. We
      separate ourselves&mdash;not in a spirit of vain glory, or from a false
      desire of freedom, we acknowledge, along with our brethren in
      Schneidemuhl, Jesus the crucified, whose pure doctrines alone, whose
      kingdom alone, whose glory and worship alone, we seek and desire, Amen!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accordingly, we hereby constitute ourselves into a Christian, Catholic,
      and Apostolic Church. We solemnly declare that we adhere to the Confession
      of Faith, in the sister Church, in all its essential points, as follows,&mdash;(here
      follows a verbal copy of the Schneidemühl Confession.) This true,
      universal faith, revealed by Christ Jesus, we now acknowledge, freely and
      truly, and promise, by God's help, to maintain and avow the same with
      unbroken steadfastness, uncorrupted and unperverted; as also to give all
      possible care that this faith be held, taught, and avowed, by those under
      us, or by those who have confidence in our intention, until our Confession
      of Faith has received the requisite alterations or enlargements in a
      future general (German) council of the chief members of the entire
      Christian-Catholic Church. May then God and his divine Gospel assist us!
      Amen!
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this Confession of Faith we have declared our inmost convictions.
      Although we are still few in number, yet we feel ourselves strong enough
      in our Christian faith to oppose' all difficulties, obstacles, and
      oppositions, and by God's grace, not to wander or waver in the way which
      has been marked out, but to remain firm in our present intentions and
      desires unto the end of our days&mdash;even though the outward means for
      carrying these out should be wanting&mdash;even though our present limited
      number should be still more limited&mdash;yet even though only one of us
      should in this life stand alone in these his convictions. At a later
      period we shall hold our public consulting assemblies, and allow, even to
      those who are most undetermined in the matter, free right of admission,
      and liberty of stating their views, that all may be convinced of our
      upright intentions.

      It were of course quite premature to criticize the doctrines, or system of
      government of the new Church, as they themselves have declared that their
      findings are not to be held as final, until they have been examined and
      approved of by a general synod or council. Meanwhile we hasten to complete
      this hurried sketch. Since the events that have taken place, Bishop
      Arnoldi has been honoured with torch-processions in Cologne and Bonn and
      Coblentz, and has been burned in effigy by the students in Jena. So far
      from wishing to undo what has been done, he has instituted an annual
      Church festival, to be called the Festival of the Holy Coat, the Nails,
      and the Lance, and to be held on the Wednesday in the third week after
      Easter. Nay, not only so, but it has been actually reported that he has
      resolved to establish another Pilgrimage in honour of the Holy Nail, which
      Prince Metternich has, after solemn conference and negociation, promised
      to restore to the Cathedral of Treves. The Bishop has lately given a proof
      of his tyranny as well as his superstition, in suspending one of the
      clergy of his diocese, by name Licht, who had dared to doubt&mdash;and to
      express his doubts to his people. He had been promised to be reinstated on
      retracting his obnoxious opinions about the Coat&mdash;but has preferred
      degradation to dishonour. Our clergy, says one account, appear to lose in
      prudence exactly as the Separatists increase. Thus, so far from the more
      extreme section of them expressing themselves with greater caution than
      formerly, some of them are declared to have taught openly since the event,
      that not only was this the <i>bonâ fide</i> Coat of our Lord, but that it
      was the <i>only Coat which he ever wore</i>&mdash;and that it grew with
      the growth of his body from the cradle to the Cross. To counteract the
      influence of the movement now in progress, Bishop Arnoldi, in conjunction
      with the Bishop of Cologne, has instituted a new Catholic Society for the
      Rhine provinces, the object of which is,&mdash;by a Monthly Journal, by
      the circulation of sermons and tracts, by the publication of standard
      Catholic works at a cheap rate, by the founding of a new Catholic library
      and the like, to diffuse a spirit of stronger Catholicity through this
      section of the Church. A member of the Theological Seminary is already
      named as its president, and collections are ordered to be made on a
      general scale in all the parishes, and specially by calls made at each
      individual house. In addition, five new journals of the same stamp have
      been established.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Protestant evangelical societies have not been asleep. The
      Gustavus-Adolphus Society (a Society founded for the support of poor
      Protestant congregations in Catholic countries, and one of the best proofs
      of the reviving spirit in the German Church,) have expressed their opinion
      that by the constitution of the Society, they are precluded from assisting
      the new movement by specific grants of money, but at the same time stating
      their desire to urge on the spirit that was abroad by all means in their
      power. Collections accordingly have been made in the various large towns,
      to defray the necessary expenses incurred by the support of clergy, the
      performance of public worship and the like. Places of meeting have been
      granted in most cases by the authorities of the town. So far as we are
      aware, only one member of the new community has openly gone over to the
      Protestant Lutheran Church.
    </p>

      In Breslau the long-vacant and much-disputed episcopal chair still remains
      unoccupied,&mdash;von Diepenbrock having expressly refused the offer, on
      the alleged ground of the unsettled state of the Church. During the late
      sittings of the Diet at Breslau, the excitement was altogether of a
      religious and not of a political kind. Ronge and the anti-Popish movement
      were the great subjects of conversation. "The Separation," says an
      account, "is widening daily, and quarters are now full of agitation which
      before were peaceful as the grave. Our ears are once more deafened by the
      No Popery cry. The congregation here now numbers above 600 families."
      Ronge is busily occupied with the affairs of the Church&mdash;delivering
      the most stirring addresses&mdash;and everywhere receiving fresh proofs of
      sympathy and support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Czerski, the pastor of Schneidemühl, has followed Luther's example in the
      matter of marriage, the Protestant clergyman officiating. He has since
      been formally degraded and excommunicated, previous to which, we believe
      that in many places seven masses were offered up daily for his return to
      the communion of the Church. In addition, all who adhere to his opinions
      have been excommunicated <i>en masse</i>. A small pamphlet has lately come
      out in Berlin, which states, that he had been always distinguished by
      great laboriousness in his parish, and that he had previously excited
      great attention by a stirring Address which he had delivered in the open
      air, on the matter of some Indulgence, pointing out the true method of
      repentance and pardon, and advising the people to have nothing farther to
      do with Indulgences, as the greatest of them could not make a man a
      Christian. He is represented as a person of great simplicity of character,
      and of deep feeling. He is firm in expressing his determination to adhere
      to the Bible and not to the Church. He and Ronge have been both, by letter
      from high quarters, admonished to be on their guard, as attempts on their
      life from some fanatics were dreaded. Several threatening letters had been
      also sent to some of the more active lay members in the new Church. At
      Breslau, on Sabbath, 9th March, the first public service was celebrated.
      Dr. Steiner delivered an Address on the momentous step which had been
      taken, and then requested the community to use the right of <i>free
      election of their pastor</i>, now restored to them. John Ronge was
      unanimously chosen. Czerski was present from Schneidemühl, to take part in
      the services of the day. Intimation was made that Kerbler, hitherto vicar
      in Lindenau, was present, and had joined the New Church. Then followed the
      induction of the new pastor into his charge. Twelve girls dressed in
      white, with garlands of flowers, formed a procession,* which was followed
      by John Ronge, Czerski, Kerbler, and the chief members of the
      congregation. Dr. Steiner then delivered a powerful Address to the new
      pastor on the duties of his office. Ronge replied to his people, and
      promised not to forsake them in joy or sorrow, after which the ordinary
      services of public worship began. After a hymn, he ascended the pulpit,
      and delivered a discourse <i>on the true character of the Church</i>,
      which he said was founded on the two maxims of Christ,&mdash;"Be ye
      perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect;" and "Love God, and your
      neighbour as yourself," and not on exclusive confessions, forms, and
      ceremonies. The great matter was to make Christianity inward and
      spiritual, and then to act accordingly. The man who did this was a true
      Christian, and herein lay the possibility of having a universal Christian
      Church, which should be one in knowledge, in love, and in deed. After
      leaving the pulpit, he read the New Confession of Faith from the altar, to
      which those present responded with a hearty "Amen." A selected piece from
      the Passion was then read, with the words of the institution of the
      Supper, which was followed by the choral, "Holy, holy, holy." The whole
      was closed with the Lord's prayer, the Hymn "Great God we praise thee,"
      and the Benediction. The service seems to be pretty nearly the same as in
      the Protestant German Church, at least as it is now celebrated in the
      Cathedral of Berlin.

     * This must be regarded as a German rather than Popish
     custom.

    <p>
      But the matter of controversy is not confined to the humble parish-priests
      of Silesia. While the two Bishops of Treves and Cologne, Arnoldi and von
      Geissel, have been issuing their annual pastoral letters in Lent, filled
      with the most extravagant declarations of ultramontane opinions, the
      Bishop of Mayence, von Kaiser, has issued a document breathing a very
      different spirit. In the former, each of the faithful is admonished in
      opposition to the movements which are at present taking place in the
      Catholic Church, to hold firmly by Rome and the Pope, as the central-point
      of the Church&mdash;is warned against apostacy and false doctrine, whilst
      the faith in relics, and what belongs thereto, is expressly inculcated.
      Bishop Kaiser, again, in a mild and tolerant spirit, dwells largely upon
      the fundamental principle of brotherly love and reconciliation, and
      although he attaches great weight to positive belief, yet, above all
      things, he gives prominence to the principle of the Apostle Paul:&mdash;"If
      I had all faith, and had not charity, I am nothing." Without this, he
      adds, all our works have no value before God. This pastoral letter has, in
      its whole contents, reference to the Church relations of the present
      times, and must be regarded as a determined protest against the wild
      proceedings of the Jesuits. He proves that it is neither Catholic nor
      Christian to make a tool of fanaticism, intolerance, and proselytism,&mdash;that
      the principle of toleration is also a Catholic one, and that both Churches
      can subsist together in peace, if the authors of disturbance were only
      powerfully restrained. He moreover <i>acknowledges the claims of
      Protestantism</i>,&mdash;a fact which, in reference to the recent course
      of events, is of vast importance:&mdash;"It is possible," says he, "for
      men of different creeds, if they have good moral principles, to live
      together in the same country, and to meet in civil life peacefully,
      friendly, and lovingly, and yet for each to remain unchangeably true to
      his individual belief. This experience has taught; already 300 years have
      past since in Germany a section of our brethren in the faith separated
      themselves from us. The division has taken place. Divine Providence has
      permitted it, and permits it still. What God permits, man should permit
      too; or should man not will it so&mdash;still he <i>must</i>. If the
      mixture of men of different creeds has once become realized as a fact,
      then has their living together become a matter of necessity. It were,
      accordingly, foolish and unreasonable, if they did not wish, as much as in
      them lay, honestly and truly, by reciprocal toleration and indulgence, to
      make these differences lighter and less felt. It were foolish,
      hypocritical, and supercilious, at the same time, if they passed judgment
      upon each other's faith and believing life harshly and uncharitably,
      rather than to be reserved in their judgment, and to consider that each
      man for himself, and among his own fellow-believers, has faults enough to
      rectify. * * * * God is love, and we prove our love of God by our love of
      man. In faith we are not at one, but in love we can and ought to be so&mdash;in
      love, we can and ought to strive with one another, and by love can we best
      show the truth and purity of our belief, and place ourselves in the best
      position for recommending it to others, until it shall please God that we
      all together should attain to the unity of the faith.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe it difficult to exaggerate the importance of this document.
      Here is a man holding a high office in the Catholic Church&mdash;living in
      the very midst of the scenes lately enacted, with two bishops on either
      side of his diocese, who seem equally ready personally to take part in, or
      with all the power of their office, to defend the most extravagant
      superstitions, or the most insidious policy of Jesuitism, with a people
      who showed how thoroughly they were given up to idolatry, and with a
      clergy equally capable of misleading or being misled,&mdash;still calmly
      lifting up his voice for a purer faith, and for the manifestation of the
      true spirit of Christian liberty and love. It seems most probable that
      this defence of <i>toleration</i> may, ere long, make its author
      personally feel what <i>intolerance</i> is. He is already denounced by the
      ultra-Catholic party in the Rhine provinces, and report says, in the
      Vatican itself. If so, we may expect to hear more of Bishop Kaiser of
      Mayence. Meanwhile, it is gratifying to state that Addresses have been
      sent to him by his clergy and fellow-citizens, fully participating in his
      spirit, and expressive of their joy that he has all along so strongly
      discountenanced the doings in the neighbouring diocese of Treves; while a
      Special Address has been presented to him from Offenbach, praying that he,
      as their spiritual guide, would lead the way in making them discard the
      leading errors of Popery. To show that this spirit of dissatisfaction is
      not confined to an individual case, we may state, that at least one other
      Bishop has, in his annual Address, passed over what has taken place
      without a single allusion or remark; nay, that even in Treves itself,
      which seems destined to become the <i>Mecca</i> of continental Popery,
      there were priests whom nothing but the fear of consequences compelled to
      take part in the degrading scenes referred to.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, in drawing this hasty sketch to a close, we have left ourselves
      room for but one or two general remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. From what has been said, it must be as a matter of fact, plain, that
      Germany is now the scene of a most remarkable awakening. Catholic Germany
      is again, after a lapse of more than three centuries, the scene of an open
      secession from the Church of Rome; and at the head of the movement stands
      one, who writes with Luther-like power&mdash;who has gone through many of
      Luther's experiences, and who has already shown that he has imbibed a vast
      deal of Luther's spirit, in deed as well as word. The occasion too, of the
      movements, was not unlike&mdash;Indulgences in the one case, and relics,
      accompanied with Indulgences, in the other, have awakened men's minds to
      see the evils of the whole system, and to shake off their connection with
      it. Congregations have been formed&mdash;a new Church is being
      established, and men on all sides say and show that they identify
      themselves with the movement. The Pope is busied now with giving new
      directions for the German Church; and is earnestly setting himself to
      narrow, as far as policy, or concession, or remonstrance can do, the evils
      of the schism which has already taken place. The new Church, it is true,
      still adheres to the name Catholic, and Ronge has said, that to pure
      Catholicism he remains true; but we quarrel not with names, if the faith
      and doings of the men be Protestant in fact. And moreover, it is at once
      evident, that as regards the immediate progress of the movement, it is
      perhaps well that Ronge should still, if he so pleases, call himself
      Catholic, as by so doing, he is not to be viewed with the same jealousy or
      distrust by his Catholic brethren, which would be the case, if he at once
      openly avowed that he had become Protestant. In this event he would be
      treated as a heretic by hundreds, whose eyes, like Luther's, may not at
      once be opened to see that the Church of Rome is not the true and only
      Church of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. As to the <i>real character</i> of the present movement, in a religious
      point of view, it becomes us, <i>as yet</i>, to speak with caution. The
      period has not arrived for our forming a proper estimate of it, as we have
      not yet all the materials for so doing; and still more as great allowance
      must be made for two circumstances&mdash;1st, The half-formed condition of
      the new community in its present transition state; and 2d, That progress
      in their views of divine truth, which may take place with them as it did
      with Luther. Meanwhile, taking both circumstances into view, it cannot be
      questioned that much of the present movement may be traced to causes other
      than those connected with the deeply Evangelical principles, which
      characterized the Reformation. It is true, the Reformation began also with
      a mere outward abuse; but this was rather the first occasion for the
      manifestation of the Christian principle, that was the soul of the
      movement in the sixteenth century, and determined its whole spiritual
      character. The great Evangelical doctrine of <i>Justification by Faith</i>
      was, <i>in principle</i>, opposed to all such practices, of which <i>Indulgences</i>
      was only one specimen; but this doctrine went a great deal further,
      namely, in supplying the positive and constructive principle of the
      Reformation throughout. The trade in Indulgences might have been opposed
      upon grounds of mere worldly politics&mdash;from an infidel hatred of all
      systems of religion&mdash;from a mere moral dislike at hypocrisy or
      superstition; but it required a true spiritual principle, connected with
      man's relation to God as a sinner, to give it its full value as regards
      the cause of Evangelical truth. The Reformation proceeded from a living
      principle within, which was at war with outward practices and systems,&mdash;instead
      of merely opposing these from principles drawn from a different circle of
      motives and actions apart from religion. Popery was overthrown by the
      French Revolution, as well as the Reformation; but no one would think of
      comparing as analagous the moral causes at work in both cases. And now as
      to Ronge's movement, we desiderate the statement of the great evangelical
      principles on which he falls back, and which would prove his struggle to
      be freed from priestly thraldom to be the desire of reaching the true
      liberty of the sons of God in Christ. It cannot be concealed that much of
      the spirit of Ronge's letters is explicable from the mere desire of
      independence of priestly tyranny, or from principles of a general
      enlightenment&mdash;or of warm patriotism, not necessarily of a religious
      character. Certain it is, that in all his productions there is much to
      desiderate; nay, we may go farther, and declare that there is much in them
      which seems to savour of the modern German Liberalism, with all its parade
      of words about the dignity of human nature, and the demands of the spirit
      of the age, and the shadowy future of an ideal perfectibility. It is not
      to be denied, moreover, that many of the Addresses sent to Ronge breathe a
      good deal the same spirit, and are sadly wanting in the strong statements
      of men who have been really made to feel that this is a matter affecting
      the salvation of the soul, and man's highest interests as an immortal
      being. This we are far from stating from feelings of suspicion or
      hypercritical jealousy. Quite the reverse. We are merely pointing out a
      source of danger in passing too hurried a decision on a movement which may
      not yet have had time or opportunities enough to bring out or establish
      its real spiritual character.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this point we have said enough, and desire that what we have said
      be not construed into an avowed opinion as to the character of this
      movement as a whole; but rather as indicating the possible direction which
      may be given to it, if the principles hinted at be really at the bottom of
      it. We earnestly hope that such is not the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. What we have now said leads us, in conclusion, to state the obligation
      which lies on the Protestants of this country to give, if possible, a
      proper direction to this movement, and to encourage it, in so far as it
      has this direction, by all means in their power. A voice from Protestant
      Britain might do much to strengthen the hands, and encourage the hearts,
      of those who are now occupied in opposing error, and, we hope, testifying
      for the truth, from a true knowledge of it as it is in Jeans. Most
      desirable it is that this movement be guarded against the influences of
      Rationalism, of whatever kind, and thus of becoming a scandal to
      Protestantism, and a new cause for the enemy to triumph. The awakened and
      evangelical Protestantism of Germany will be ready to co-operate with us
      and with them, in proportion to their increased purity of creed, and their
      daily increasing activity and efficiency as a branch of the Church of
      Christ. A noble opportunity seems now, in the providence of God,
      presented, for drawing together different parts of the Christian Church,
      as well as of aiding in a great effort to overthrow the system which has
      so long kept the nations in the very darkness of the shadow of death. We
      have means of knowing that many of the best and wisest men in Germany
      believe that we are now standing on the threshold of great events; and
      meanwhile, when on both sides of the Alps, Popery is reorganizing itself
      for a new and fierce attack on Christendom and Heathenism alike, it is
      most gratifying to know that in the very country of the Reformation&mdash;aye,
      and in the bosom of the Catholic Church itself, there should still be
      found slumbering the spirit of Luther and his times. Let us hope that the
      presence of Him who led the spirit of Luther to larger conceptions of
      Divine Truth, and gave him courage equal to his mighty work, may now be
      vouchsafed to many who, like him, may still be groping in a kind of
      twilight knowledge and faith, and be led, as all around and within them
      brightens, to have no longer any fellowship with the works of darkness!
      May God grant the Churches of Christendom light to act as becomes the
      emergency; and may all that has taken place, or that may yet take place,
      in connection therewith, tend to advance the kingdom of our Lord and
      Saviour Jesus Christ. We conclude with the well known words of Luther:&mdash;"If
      this is God's work it will advance; if it be man's it will come to
      nought."

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
