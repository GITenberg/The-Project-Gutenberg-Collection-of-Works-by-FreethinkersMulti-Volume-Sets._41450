      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      THESE Excursions in the Byways of Thought were undertaken at different
      times and on different occasions; consequently, the reader may be able to
      detect in them inequalities of treatment. He may feel that I have lingered
      too long in some byways and hurried too rapidly through others, taking, as
      it were, but a general view of the road in the latter case, whilst
      examining everything that could be seen in the former with, perhaps, undue
      care. As a matter of fact, how ever, all these excursions have been
      undertaken with one and the same object in view, that, namely, of
      understanding aright and appreciating at their true worth some of the more
      curious byways along which human thought has travelled. It is easy for the
      superficial thinker to dismiss much of the thought of the past (and,
      indeed, of the present) as <i>mere</i> superstition, not worth the trouble
      of investigation: but it is not scientific. There is a reason for every
      belief, even the most fantastic, and it should be our object to discover
      this reason. How far, if at all, the reason in any case justifies us in
      holding a similar belief is, of course, another question. Some of the
      beliefs I have dealt with I have treated at greater length than others,
      because it seems to me that the truths of which they are the images&mdash;vague
      and distorted in many cases though they be&mdash;are truths which we have
      either forgotten nowadays, or are in danger of forgetting. We moderns may,
      indeed, learn something from the thought of the past, even in its most
      fantastic aspects. In one excursion at least, namely, the essay on "The
      Cambridge Platonists," I have ventured to deal with a higher phase&mdash;perhaps
      I should say the highest phase&mdash;of the thought of a bygone age, to
      which the modern world may be completely debtor.

    <h2>
      I. SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF MEDAEVAL THOUGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN the earliest days of his upward evolution man was satisfied with a very
      crude explanation of natural phenomena&mdash;that to which the name
      "animism" has been given. In this stage of mental development all the
      various forces of Nature are personified: the rushing torrent, the
      devastating fire, the wind rustling the forest leaves&mdash;in the mind of
      the animistic savage all these are personalities, spirits, like himself,
      but animated by motives more or less antagonistic to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose that no possible exception could be taken to the statement that
      modern science renders animism impossible. But let us inquire in exactly
      what sense this is true. It is not true that science robs natural
      phenomena of their spiritual significance. The mistake is often made of
      supposing that science explains, or endeavours to explain, phenomena. But
      that is the business of philosophy. The task science attempts is the
      simpler one of the correlation of natural phenomena, and in this effort
      leaves the ultimate problems of metaphysics untouched. A universe,
      however, whose phenomena are not only capable of some degree of
      correlation, but present the extraordinary degree of harmony and unity
      which science makes manifest in Nature, cannot be, as in animism, the
      product of a vast number of inco-ordinated and antagonistic wills, but
      must either be the product of one Will, or not the product of will at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter alternative means that the Cosmos is inexplicable, which not
      only man's growing experience, but the fact that man and the universe form
      essentially a unity, forbid us to believe. The term "anthropomorphic" is
      too easily applied to philosophical systems, as if it constituted a
      criticism of their validity. For if it be true, as all must admit, that
      the unknown can only be explained in terms of the known, then the universe
      must either be explained in terms of man&mdash;<i>i.e</i>. in terms of
      will or desire&mdash;or remain incomprehensible. That is to say, a
      philosophy must either be anthropomorphic, or no philosophy at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus a metaphysical scrutiny of the results of modern science leads us to
      a belief in God. But man felt the need of unity, and crude animism, though
      a step in the right direction, failed to satisfy his thought, long before
      the days of modern science. The spirits of animism, however, were not
      discarded, but were modified, co-ordinated, and worked into a system as
      servants of the Most High. Polytheism may mark a stage in this process;
      or, perhaps, it was a result of mental degeneracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I may term systematised as distinguished from crude animism persisted
      throughout the Middle Ages. The work of systematisation had already been
      accomplished, to a large extent, by the Neo-Platonists and whoever were
      responsible for the Kabala. It is true that these main sources of magical
      or animistic philosophy remained hidden during the greater part of the
      Middle Ages; but at about their close the youthful and enthusiastic
      CORNELIUS AGRIPPA (1486-1535)(1) slaked his thirst thereat and produced
      his own attempt at the systematisation of magical belief in the famous <i>Three
      Books of Occult Philosophy</i>. But the waters of magical philosophy
      reached the mediaeval mind through various devious channels, traditional
      on the one hand and literary on the other. And of the latter, the works of
      pseudo-DIONYSIUS,(2) whose immense influence upon mediaeval thought has
      sometimes been neglected, must certainly be noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) The story of his life has been admirably told by HENRY MORLEY (2
      vols., 1856).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) These writings were first heard of in the early part of the sixth
      century, and were probably the work of a Syrian monk of that date, who
      fathered them on to DIONYSIUS the Areopagite as a pious fraud. See Dean
      INGE'S <i>Christian Mysticism</i> (1899), pp. 104&mdash;122, and VAUGHAN'S
      <i>Hours with the Mystics</i> (7th ed., 1895), vol. i. pp. 111-124. The
      books have been translated into English by the Rev. JOHN PARKER (2
      vols.1897-1899), who believes in the genuineness of their alleged
      authorship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most obvious example of a mediaeval animistic belief is that in
      "elementals"&mdash;the spirits which personify the primordial forces of
      Nature, and are symbolised by the four elements, immanent in which they
      were supposed to exist, and through which they were held to manifest their
      powers. And astrology, it must be remembered, is essentially a
      systematised animism. The stars, to the ancients, were not material bodies
      like the earth, but spiritual beings. PLATO (427-347 B.C.) speaks of them
      as "gods". Mediaeval thought did not regard them in quite this way. But
      for those who believed in astrology, and few, I think, did not, the stars
      were still symbols of spiritual forces operative on man. Evidences of the
      wide extent of astrological belief in those days are abundant, many
      instances of which we shall doubtless encounter in our excursions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that the theological and philosophical atmosphere of the
      Middle Ages was "scholastic," not mystical. No doubt "mysticism," as a
      mode of life aiming at the realisation of the presence of God, is as
      distinct from scholasticism as empiricism is from rationalism, or
      "tough-minded" philosophy (to use JAMES' happy phrase) is from
      "tender-minded". But no philosophy can be absolutely and purely deductive.
      It must start from certain empirically determined facts. A man might be an
      extreme empiricist in religion (<i>i.e</i>. a mystic), and yet might
      attempt to deduce all other forms of knowledge from the results of his
      religious experiences, never caring to gather experience in any other
      realm. Hence the breach between mysticism and scholasticism is not really
      so wide as may appear at first sight. Indeed, scholasticism officially
      recognised three branches of theology, of which the MYSTICAL was one. I
      think that mysticism and scholasticism both had a profound influence on
      the mediaeval mind, sometimes acting as opposing forces, sometimes
      operating harmoniously with one another. As Professor WINDELBAND puts it:
      "We no longer onesidedly characterise the philosophy of the middle ages as
      scholasticism, but rather place mysticism beside it as of equal rank, and
      even as being the more fruitful and promising movement."(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) Professor WILHELM WINDELBAND, Ph.D.: "Present-Day Mysticism," <i>The
      Quest</i>, vol. iv. (1913), P. 205.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alchemy, with its four Aristotelian or scholastic elements and its three
      mystical principles&mdash;sulphur, mercury, salt,&mdash;must be cited as
      the outstanding product of the combined influence of mysticism and
      scholasticism: of mysticism, which postulated the unity of the Cosmos, and
      hence taught that everything natural is the expressive image and type of
      some supernatural reality; of scholasticism, which taught men to rely upon
      deduction and to restrict experimentation to the smallest possible limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mind naturally proceeds from the known, or from what is supposed to be
      known, to the unknown. Indeed, as I have already indicated, it must so
      proceed if truth is to be gained. Now what did the men of the Middle Ages
      regard as falling into the category of the known? Why, surely, the truths
      of revealed religion, whether accepted upon authority or upon the evidence
      of their own experience. The realm of spiritual and moral reality: there,
      they felt, they were on firm ground. Nature was a realm unknown; but they
      had analogy to guide, or, rather, misguide them. Nevertheless if, as we
      know, it misguided, this was not, I think, because the mystical doctrine
      of the correspondence between the spiritual and the natural is unsound,
      but because these ancient seekers into Nature's secrets knew so little,
      and so frequently misapplied what they did know. So alchemical philosophy
      arose and became systematised, with its wonderful endeavour to perfect the
      base metals by the Philosopher's Stone&mdash;the concentrated Essence of
      Nature,&mdash;as man's soul is perfected through the life-giving power of
      JESUS CHRIST.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want, in conclusion to these brief introductory remarks, to say a few
      words concerning phallicism in connection with my topic. For some
      "tender-minded"(1) and, to my thought, obscure, reason the subject is
      tabooed. Even the British Museum does not include works on phallicism in
      its catalogue, and special permission has to be obtained to consult them.
      Yet the subject is of vast importance as concerns the origin and
      development of religion and philosophy, and the extent of phallic worship
      may be gathered from the widespread occurrence of obelisks and similar
      objects amongst ancient relics. Our own maypole dances may be instanced as
      one survival of the ancient worship of the male generative principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) I here use the term with the extended meaning Mr H. G. WELLS has given
      to it. See <i>The New Machiavelli</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could be more easy to understand than that, when man first questioned
      as to the creation of the earth, he should suppose it to have been
      generated by some process analogous to that which he saw held in the case
      of man? How else could he account for its origin, if knowledge must
      proceed from the known to the unknown? No one questions at all that the
      worship of the human generative organs as symbols of the dual generative
      principle of Nature degenerated into orgies of the most frightful
      character, but the view of Nature which thus degenerated is not, I think,
      an altogether unsound one, and very interesting remnants of it are to be
      found in mediaeval philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      These remnants are very marked in alchemy. The metals, as I have
      suggested, are there regarded as types of man; hence they are produced
      from seed, through the combination of male and female principles&mdash;mercury
      and sulphur, which on the spiritual plane are intelligence and love. The
      same is true of that Stone which is perfect Man. As BERNARD of TREVISAN
      (1406-1490) wrote in the fifteenth century: "This Stone then is compounded
      of a Body and Spirit, or of a volatile and fixed Substance, and that is
      therefore done, because nothing in the World can be generated and brought
      to light without these two Substances, to wit, a Male and Female: From
      whence it appeareth, that although these two Substances are not of one and
      the same species, yet one Stone doth thence arise, and although they
      appear and are said to be two Substances, yet in truth it is but one, to
      wit, <i>Argent-vive</i>."(1) No doubt this sounds fantastic; but with all
      their seeming intellectual follies these old thinkers were no fools. The
      fact of sex is the most fundamental fact of the universe, and is a
      spiritual and physical as well as a physiological fact. I shall deal with
      the subject as concerns the speculations of the alchemists in some detail
      in a later excursion.

    <h2>
      II. PYTHAGORAS AND HIS PHILOSOPHY
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT is a matter for enduring regret that so little is known to us
      concerning PYTHAGORAS. What little we do know serves but to enhance for us
      the interest of the man and his philosophy, to make him, in many ways, the
      most attractive of Greek thinkers; and, basing our estimate on the extent
      of his influence on the thought of succeeding ages, we recognise in him
      one of the world's master-minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      PYTHAGORAS was born about 582 B.C. at Samos, one of the Grecian isles. In
      his youth he came in contact with THALES&mdash;the Father of Geometry, as
      he is well called,&mdash;and though he did not become a member of THALES'
      school, his contact with the latter no doubt helped to turn his mind
      towards the study of geometry. This interest found the right ground for
      its development in Egypt, which he visited when still young. Egypt is
      generally regarded as the birthplace of geometry, the subject having, it
      is supposed, been forced on the minds of the Egyptians by the necessity of
      fixing the boundaries of lands against the annual overflowing of the Nile.
      But the Egyptians were what is called an essentially practical people, and
      their geometrical knowledge did not extend beyond a few empirical rules
      useful for fixing these boundaries and in constructing their temples.
      Striking evidence of this fact is supplied by the AHMES papyrus, compiled
      some little time before 1700 B.C. from an older work dating from about
      3400 B.C.,(1) a papyrus which almost certainly represents the highest
      mathematical knowledge reached by the Egyptians of that day. Geometry is
      treated very superficially and as of subsidiary interest to arithmetic;
      there is no ordered series of reasoned geometrical propositions given&mdash;nothing,
      indeed, beyond isolated rules, and of these some are wanting in accuracy.

      Aegypter</i> (1877); J. Gow: <i>A Short History of Greek Mathematics</i>

      Ancient Books</i> (1891).

      One geometrical fact known to the Egyptians was that if a triangle be
      constructed having its sides 3, 4, and 5 units long respectively, then the
      angle opposite the longest side is exactly a right angle; and the Egyptian
      builders used this rule for constructing walls perpendicular to each
      other, employing a cord graduated in the required manner. The Greek mind
      was not, however, satisfied with the bald statement of mere facts&mdash;it
      cared little for practical applications, but sought above all for the
      underlying REASON of everything. Nowadays we are beginning to realise that
      the results achieved by this type of mind, the general laws of Nature's
      behaviour formulated by its endeavours, are frequently of immense
      practical importance&mdash;of far more importance than the mere
      rules-of-thumb beyond which so-called practical minds never advance. The
      classic example of the utility of seemingly useless knowledge is afforded
      by Sir WILLIAM HAMILTON'S discovery, or, rather, invention of
      Quarternions, but no better example of the utilitarian triumph of the
      theoretical over the so-called practical mind can be adduced than that
      afforded by PYTHAGORAS. Given this rule for constructing a right angle,
      about whose reason the Egyptian who used it never bothered himself, and
      the mind of PYTHAGORAS, searching for its full significance, made that
      gigantic geometrical discovery which is to this day known as the Theorem
      of PYTHAGORAS&mdash;the law that in every right-angled triangle the square
      on the side opposite the right angle is equal in area to the sum of the
      squares on the other two sides.(1) The importance of this discovery can
      hardly be overestimated. It is of fundamental importance in most branches
      of geometry, and the basis of the whole of trigonometry&mdash;the special
      branch of geometry that deals with the practical mensuration of triangles.
      EUCLID devoted the whole of the first book of his <i>Elements of Geometry</i>
      to establishing the truth of this theorem; how PYTHAGORAS demonstrated it
      we unfortunately do not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) Fig. 3 affords an interesting practical demonstration of the truth of
      this theorem. If the reader will copy this figure, cut out the squares on
      the two shorter sides of the triangle and divide them along the lines AD,
      BE, EF, he will find that the five pieces so obtained can be made exactly
      to fit the square on the longest side as shown by the dotted lines. The
      size and shape of the triangle ABC, so long as it has a right angle at C,
      is immaterial. The lines AD, BE are obtained by continuing the sides of
      the square on the side AB, <i>i.e</i>. the side opposite the right angle,
      and EF is drawn at right angles to BE.
    </p>
    <p>
      After absorbing what knowledge was to be gained in Egypt, PYTHAGORAS
      journeyed to Babylon, where he probably came into contact with even
      greater traditions and more potent influences and sources of knowledge
      than in Egypt, for there is reason for believing that the ancient
      Chaldeans were the builders of the Pyramids and in many ways the
      intellectual superiors of the Egyptians.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after having travelled still further East, probably as far as
      India, PYTHAGORAS returned to his birthplace to teach the men of his
      native land the knowledge he had gained. But CROESUS was tyrant over
      Samos, and so oppressive was his rule that none had leisure in which to
      learn. Not a student came to PYTHAGORAS, until, in despair, so the story
      runs, he offered to pay an artisan if he would but learn geometry. The man
      accepted, and later, when PYTHAGORAS pretended inability any longer to
      continue the payments, he offered, so fascinating did he find the subject,
      to pay his teacher instead if the lessons might only be continued.
      PYTHAGORAS no doubt was much gratified at this; and the motto he adopted
      for his great Brotherhood, of which we shall make the acquaintance in a
      moment, was in all likelihood based on this event. It ran, "Honour a
      figure and a step before a figure and a tribolus"; or, as a freer
      translation renders it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "A figure and a step onward Not a figure and a florin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events," as Mr FRANKLAND remarks, "the motto is a lasting witness
      to a very singular devotion to knowledge for its own sake."(1)

      But PYTHAGORAS needed a greater audience than one man, however
      enthusiastic a pupil he might be, and he left Samos for Southern Italy,
      the rich inhabitants of whose cities had both the leisure and inclination
      to study. Delphi, far-famed for its Oracles, was visited <i>en route</i>,
      and PYTHAGORAS, after a sojourn at Tarentum, settled at Croton, where he
      gathered about him a great band of pupils, mainly young people of the
      aristocratic class. By consent of the Senate of Croton, he formed out of
      these a great philosophical brotherhood, whose members lived apart from
      the ordinary people, forming, as it were, a separate community. They were
      bound to PYTHAGORAS by the closest ties of admiration and reverence, and,
      for years after his death, discoveries made by Pythagoreans were
      invariably attributed to the Master, a fact which makes it very difficult
      exactly to gauge the extent of PYTHAGORAS' own knowledge and achievements.
      The regime of the Brotherhood, or Pythagorean Order, was a strict one,
      entailing "high thinking and low living" at all times. A restricted diet,
      the exact nature of which is in dispute, was observed by all members, and
      long periods of silence, as conducive to deep thinking, were imposed on
      novices. Women were admitted to the Order, and PYTHAGORAS' asceticism did
      not prohibit romance, for we read that one of his fair pupils won her way
      to his heart, and, declaring her affection for him, found it reciprocated
      and became his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCHURE writes: "By his marriage with Theano, Pythagoras affixed <i>the
      seal of realization</i> to his work. The union and fusion of the two lives
      was complete. One day when the master's wife was asked what length of time
      elapsed before a woman could become pure after intercourse with a man, she
      replied: 'If it is with her husband, she is pure all the time; if with
      another man, she is never pure.'" "Many women," adds the writer, "would
      smilingly remark that to give such a reply one must be the wife of
      Pythagoras, and love him as Theano did. And they would be in the right,
      for it is not marriage that sanctifies love, it is love which justifies
      marriage."(1)

      PYTHAGORAS was not merely a mathematician, he was first and foremost a
      philosopher, whose philosophy found in number the basis of all things,
      because number, for him, alone possessed stability of relationship. As I
      have remarked on a former occasion, "The theory that the Cosmos has its
      origin and explanation in Number... is one for which it is not difficult
      to account if we take into consideration the nature of the times in which
      it was formulated. The Greek of the period, looking upon Nature, beheld no
      picture of harmony, uniformity and fundamental unity. The outer world
      appeared to him rather as a discordant chaos, the mere sport and plaything
      of the gods. The theory of the uniformity of Nature&mdash;that Nature is
      ever like to herself&mdash;the very essence of the modern scientific
      spirit, had yet to be born of years of unwearied labour and unceasing
      delving into Nature's innermost secrets. Only in Mathematics&mdash;in the
      properties of geometrical figures, and of numbers&mdash;was the reign of
      law, the principle of harmony, perceivable. Even at this present day when
      the marvellous has become commonplace, that property of right-angled
      triangles... already discussed... comes to the mind as a remarkable and
      notable fact: it must have seemed a stupendous marvel to its discoverer,
      to whom, it appears, the regular alternation of the odd and even numbers,
      a fact so obvious to us that we are inclined to attach no importance to
      it, seemed, itself, to be something wonderful. Here in Geometry and
      Arithmetic, here was order and harmony unsurpassed and unsurpassable. What
      wonder then that Pythagoras concluded that the solution of the mighty
      riddle of the Universe was contained in the mysteries of Geometry? What
      wonder that he read mystic meanings into the laws of Arithmetic, and
      believed Number to be the explanation and origin of all that is?"(1)

      No doubt the Pythagorean theory suffers from a defect similar to that of
      the Kabalistic doctrine, which, starting from the fact that all words are
      composed of letters, representing the primary sounds of language,
      maintained that all the things represented by these words were created by
      God by means of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. But at the
      same time the Pythagorean theory certainly embodies a considerable element
      of truth. Modern science demonstrates nothing more clearly than the
      importance of numerical relationships. Indeed, "the history of science
      shows us the gradual transformation of crude facts of experience into
      increasingly exact generalisations by the application to them of
      mathematics. The enormous advances that have been made in recent years in
      physics and chemistry are very largely due to mathematical methods of
      interpreting and co-ordinating facts experimentally revealed, whereby
      further experiments have been suggested, the results of which have
      themselves been mathematically interpreted. Both physics and chemistry,
      especially the former, are now highly mathematical. In the biological
      sciences and especially in psychology it is true that mathematical methods
      are, as yet, not so largely employed. But these sciences are far less
      highly developed, far less exact and systematic, that is to say, far less
      scientific, at present, than is either physics or chemistry. However, the
      application of statistical methods promises good results, and there are
      not wanting generalisations already arrived at which are expressible
      mathematically; Weber's Law in psychology, and the law concerning the
      arrangement of the leaves about the stems of plants in biology, may be
      instanced as cases in point."(1)

      The Pythagorean doctrine of the Cosmos, in its most reasonable form,
      however, is confronted with one great difficulty which it seems incapable
      of overcoming, namely, that of continuity. Modern science, with its atomic
      theories of matter and electricity, does, indeed, show us that the
      apparent continuity of material things is spurious, that all material
      things consist of discrete particles, and are hence measurable in
      numerical terms. But modern science is also obliged to postulate an ether
      behind these atoms, an ether which is wholly continuous, and hence
      transcends the domain of number.(1) It is true that, in quite recent
      times, a certain school of thought has argued that the ether is also
      atomic in constitution&mdash;that all things, indeed, have a grained
      structure, even forces being made up of a large number of quantums or
      indivisible units of force. But this view has not gained general
      acceptance, and it seems to necessitate the postulation of an ether beyond
      the ether, filling the interspaces between its atoms, to obviate the
      difficulty of conceiving of action at a distance.

    <p>
      According to BERGSON, life&mdash;the reality that can only be lived, not
      understood&mdash;is absolutely continuous (<i>i.e</i>. not amenable to
      numerical treatment). It is because life is absolutely continuous that we
      cannot, he says, understand it; for reason acts discontinuously, grasping
      only, so to speak, a cinematographic view of life, made up of an immense
      number of instantaneous glimpses. All that passes between the glimpses is
      lost, and so the true whole, reason can never synthesise from that which
      it possesses. On the other hand, one might also argue&mdash;extending, in
      a way, the teaching of the physical sciences of the period between the
      postulation of DALTON'S atomic theory and the discovery of the
      significance of the ether of space&mdash;that reality is essentially
      discontinuous, our idea that it is continuous being a mere illusion
      arising from the coarseness of our senses. That might provide a complete
      vindication of the Pythagorean view; but a better vindication, if not of
      that theory, at any rate of PYTHAGORAS' philosophical attitude, is
      forthcoming, I think, in the fact that modern mathematics has transcended
      the shackles of number, and has enlarged her kingdom, so as to include
      quantities other than numerical. PYTHAGORAS, had he been born in these
      latter centuries, would surely have rejoiced in this, enlargement, whereby
      the continuous as well as the discontinuous is brought, if not under the
      rule of number, under the rule of mathematics indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      PYTHAGORAS' foremost achievement in mathematics I have already mentioned.
      Another notable piece of work in the same department was the discovery of
      a method of constructing a parallelogram having a side equal to a given
      line, an angle equal to a given angle, and its area equal to that of a
      given triangle. PYTHAGORAS is said to have celebrated this discovery by
      the sacrifice of a whole ox. The problem appears in the first book of
      EUCLID'S <i>Elements of Geometry</i> as proposition 44. In fact, many of
      the propositions of EUCLID'S first, second, fourth, and sixth books were
      worked out by PYTHAGORAS and the Pythagoreans; but, curiously enough, they
      seem greatly to have neglected the geometry of the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The symmetrical solids were regarded by PYTHAGORAS, and by the Greek
      thinkers after him, as of the greatest importance. To be perfectly
      symmetrical or regular, a solid must have an equal number of faces meeting
      at each of its angles, and these faces must be equal regular polygons, <i>i.e</i>.
      figures whose sides and angles are all equal. PYTHAGORAS, perhaps, may be
      credited with the great discovery that there are only five such solids.
      These are as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tetrahedron, having four equilateral triangles as faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cube, having six squares as faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Octahedron, having eight equilateral triangles as faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dodecahedron, having twelve regular pentagons (or five-sided figures)
      as faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Icosahedron, having twenty equilateral triangles as faces.(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) If the reader will copy figs. 4 to 8 on cardboard or stiff paper, bend
      each along the dotted lines so as to form a solid, fastening together the
      free edges with gummed paper, he will be in possession of models of the
      five solids in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the Greeks believed the world to be composed of four elements&mdash;earth,
      air, fire, water,&mdash;and to the Greek mind the conclusion was
      inevitable(2a) that the shapes of the particles of the elements were those
      of the regular solids. Earth-particles were cubical, the cube being the
      regular solid possessed of greatest stability; fire-particles were
      tetrahedral, the tetrahedron being the simplest and, hence, lightest
      solid. Water-particles were icosahedral for exactly the reverse reason,
      whilst air-particles, as intermediate between the two latter, were
      octahedral. The dodecahedron was, to these ancient mathematicians, the
      most mysterious of the solids: it was by far the most difficult to
      construct, the accurate drawing of the regular pentagon necessitating a
      rather elaborate application of PYTHAGORAS' great theorem.(1) Hence the
      conclusion, as PLATO put it, that "this (the regular dodecahedron) the
      Deity employed in tracing the plan of the Universe."(2b) Hence also the
      high esteem in which the pentagon was held by the Pythagoreans. By
      producing each side of this latter figure the five-pointed star (fig. 9),
      known as the pentagram, is obtained. This was adopted by the Pythagoreans
      as the badge of their Society, and for many ages was held as a symbol
      possessed of magic powers. The mediaeval magicians made use of it in their
      evocations, and as a talisman it was held in the highest esteem.

      the innermost secrets of nature lay in the lap of geometry, and the
      extraordinary inference follows that Euclid's <i>Elements</i>, which are
      devoted to the investigation of the regular solids, are therefore in
      reality and at bottom an attempt to 'solve the universe.' Euclid, in fact,
      made this goal of the Pythagoreans the aim of his <i>Elements</i>."&mdash;<i>Op.

      Music played an important part in the curriculum of the Pythagorean
      Brotherhood, and the important discovery that the relations between the
      notes of musical scales can be expressed by means of numbers is a
      Pythagorean one. It must have seemed to its discoverer&mdash;as, in a
      sense, it indeed is&mdash;a striking confirmation of the numerical theory
      of the Cosmos. The Pythagoreans held that the positions of the heavenly
      bodies were governed by similar numerical relations, and that in
      consequence their motion was productive of celestial music. This concept
      of "the harmony of the spheres" is among the most celebrated of the
      Pythagorean doctrines, and has found ready acceptance in many
      mystically-speculative minds. "Look how the floor of heaven," says Lorenzo
      in SHAKESPEARE'S <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 "... Look how the floor of heaven
 Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
 There's not the smallest orb which thou behold's"
 But in his motion like an angel sings,
 Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
 Such harmony is in immortal souls;
 But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
 Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it."(1)

      Or, as KINGSLEY writes in one of his letters, "When I walk the fields I am
      oppressed every now and then with an innate feeling that everything I see
      has a meaning, if I could but understand it. And this feeling of being
      surrounded with truths which I cannot grasp, amounts to an indescribable
      awe sometimes! Everything seems to be full of God's reflex, if we could
      but see it. Oh! how I have prayed to have the mystery unfolded, at least
      hereafter. To see, if but for a moment, the whole harmony of the great
      system! To hear once the music which the whole universe makes as it
      performs His bidding!"(1) In this connection may be mentioned the very
      significant fact that the Pythagoreans did not consider the earth, in
      accordance with current opinion, to be a stationary body, but believed
      that it and the other planets revolved about a central point, or fire, as
      they called it.

      As concerns PYTHAGORAS' ethical teaching, judging from the so-called <i>Golden
      Verses</i> attributed to him, and no doubt written by one of his
      disciples,(2) this would appear to be in some respects similar to that of
      the Stoics who came later, but free from the materialism of the Stoic
      doctrines. Due regard for oneself is blended with regard for the gods and
      for other men, the atmosphere of the whole being at once rational and
      austere. One verse&mdash;"Thou shalt likewise know, according to Justice,
      that the nature of this Universe is in all things alike"(3)&mdash;is of
      particular interest, as showing PYTHAGORAS' belief in that principle of
      analogy&mdash;that "What is below is as that which is above, what is above
      is as that which is below"&mdash;which held so dominant a sway over the
      minds of ancient and mediaeval philosophers, leading them&mdash;in spite,
      I suggest, of its fundamental truth&mdash;into so many fantastic errors,
      as we shall see in future excursions. Metempsychosis was another of the
      Pythagorean tenets, a fact which is interesting in view of the modern
      revival of this doctrine. PYTHAGORAS, no doubt, derived it from the East,
      apparently introducing it for the first time to Western thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) It seems probable, though not certain, that PYTHAGORAS wrote nothing
      himself, but taught always by the oral method.

      Such, in brief, were the outstanding doctrines of the Pythagorean
      Brotherhood. Their teachings included, as we have seen, what may justly be
      called scientific discoveries of the first importance, as well as
      doctrines which, though we may feel compelled&mdash;perhaps rightly&mdash;to
      regard them as fantastic now, had an immense influence on the thought of
      succeeding ages, especially on Greek philosophy as represented by PLATO
      and the Neo-Platonists, and the more speculative minds&mdash;the occult
      philosophers, shall I say?&mdash;of the latter mediaeval period and
      succeeding centuries. The Brotherhood, however, was not destined to
      continue its days in peace. As I have indicated, it was a philosophical,
      not a political, association; but naturally PYTHAGORAS' philosophy
      included political doctrines. At any rate, the Brotherhood acquired a
      considerable share in the government of Croton, a fact which was greatly
      resented by the members of the democratic party, who feared the loss of
      their rights; and, urged thereto, it is said, by a rejected applicant for
      membership of the Order, the mob made an onslaught on the Brotherhood's
      place of assembly and burnt it to the ground. One account has it that
      PYTHAGORAS himself died in the conflagration, a sacrifice to the mad fury
      of the mob. According to another account&mdash;and we like to believe that
      this is the true one&mdash;he escaped to Tarentum, from which he was
      banished, to find an asylum in Metapontum, where he lived his last years
      in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pythagorean Order was broken up, but the bonds of brotherhood still
      existed between its members. "One of them who had fallen upon sickness and
      poverty was kindly taken in by an innkeeper. Before dying he traced a few
      mysterious signs (the pentagram, no doubt) on the door of the inn and said
      to the host: 'Do not be uneasy, one of my brothers will pay my debts.' A
      year afterwards, as a stranger was passing by this inn he saw the signs
      and said to the host: 'I am a Pythagorean; one of my brothers died here;
      tell me what I owe you on his account.'"(1)

      In endeavouring to estimate the worth of PYTHAGORAS' discoveries and
      teaching, Mr FRANKLAND writes, with reference to his achievements in
      geometry: "Even after making a considerable allowance for his pupils'
      share, the Master's geometrical work calls for much admiration"; and, "...
      it cannot be far wrong to suppose that it was Pythagoras' wont to insist
      upon proofs, and so to secure that rigour which gives to mathematics its
      honourable position amongst the sciences." And of his work in arithmetic,
      music, and astronomy, the same author writes: "... everywhere he appears
      to have inaugurated genuinely scientific methods, and to have laid the
      foundations of a high and liberal education"; adding, "For nearly a score
      of centuries, to the very close of the Middle Ages, the four Pythagorean
      subjects of study&mdash;arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music&mdash;were
      the staple educational course, and were bound together into a fourfold way
      of knowledge&mdash;the Quadrivium."(1) With these words of due praise, our
      present excursion may fittingly close.

      III. MEDICINE AND MAGIC
    </h2>
    <p>
      THERE are few tasks at once so instructive and so fascinating as the
      tracing of the development of the human mind as manifested in the
      evolution of scientific and philosophical theories. And this is, perhaps,
      especially true when, as in the case of medicine, this evolution has
      followed paths so tortuous, intersected by so many fantastic byways, that
      one is not infrequently doubtful as to the true road. The history of
      medicine is at once the history of human wisdom and the history of human
      credulity and folly, and the romantic element (to use the expression in
      its popular acceptation) thus introduced, whilst making the subject more
      entertaining, by no means detracts from its importance considered
      psychologically.
    </p>
    <p>
      To whom the honour of having first invented medicines is due is unknown,
      the origins of pharmacy being lost in the twilight of myth. OSIRIS and
      ISIS, BACCHUS, APOLLO father of the famous physician AESCULAPIUS, and
      CHIRON the Centaur, tutor of the latter, are among the many mythological
      personages who have been accredited with the invention of physic. It is
      certain that the art of compounding medicines is extraordinarily ancient.
      There is a papyrus in the British Museum containing medical prescriptions
      which was written about 1200 B.C.; and the famous EBERS papyrus, which is
      devoted to medical matters, is reckoned to date from about the year 1550
      B.C. It is interesting to note that in the prescriptions given in this
      latter papyrus, as seems to have been the case throughout the history of
      medicine, the principle that the efficacy of a medicine is in proportion
      to its nastiness appears to have been the main idea. Indeed, many old
      medicines contained ingredients of the most disgusting nature imaginable:
      a mediaeval remedy known as oil of puppies, made by cutting up two
      newly-born puppies and boiling them with one pound of live earthworms, may
      be cited as a comparatively pleasant example of the remedies (?) used in
      the days when all sorts of excreta were prescribed as medicines.(1)

      Presumably the oldest theory concerning the causation of disease is that
      which attributes all the ills of mankind to the malignant operations of
      evil spirits, a theory which someone has rather fancifully suggested is
      not so erroneous after all, if we may be allowed to apply the term "evil
      spirits" to the microbes of modern bacteriology. Remnants of this theory
      (which does&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;conceal a transcendental truth), that
      is, in its original form, still survive to the present day in various
      superstitious customs, whose absurdity does not need emphasising: for
      example, the use of red flannel by old-fashioned folk with which to tie up
      sore throats&mdash;red having once been supposed to be a colour very
      angatonistic to evil spirits; so much so that at one time red cloth hung
      in the patient's room was much employed as a cure for smallpox!
    </p>
    <p>
      Medicine and magic have always been closely associated. Indeed, the
      greatest name in the history of pharmacy is also what is probably the
      greatest name in the history of magic&mdash;the reference, of course,
      being to PARACELSUS (1493-1541). Until PARACELSUS, partly by his vigorous
      invective and partly by his remarkable cures of various diseases,
      demolished the old school of medicine, no one dared contest the authority
      of GALEN (130-<i>circa</i> 205) and AVICENNA (980&mdash;1037). GALEN'S
      theory of disease was largely based upon that of the four humours in man&mdash;bile,
      blood, phlegm, and black bile,&mdash;which were regarded as related to
      (but not identical with) the four elements&mdash;fire, air, water, and
      earth,&mdash;being supposed to have characters similar to these. Thus, to
      bile, as to fire, were attributed the properties of hotness and dryness;
      to blood and air those of hotness and moistness; to phlegm and water those
      of coldness and moistness; and, finally, black bile, like earth, was said
      to be cold and dry. GALEN supposed that an alteration in the due
      proportion of these humours gives rise to disease, though he did not
      consider this to be its only cause; thus, cancer, it was thought, might
      result from an excess of black bile, and rheumatism from an excess of
      phlegm. Drugs, GALEN argued, are of efficiency in the curing of disease,
      according as they possess one or more of these so-called fundamental
      properties, hotness, dryness, coldness, and moistness, whereby it was
      considered that an excess of any humour might be counteracted; moreover,
      it was further assumed that four degrees of each property exist, and that
      only those drugs are of use in curing a disease which contain the
      necessary property or properties in the degree proportionate to that in
      which the opposite humour or humours are in excess in the patient's
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARACELSUS' views were based upon his theory (undoubtedly true in a sense)
      that man is a microcosm, a world in miniature.(1) Now, all things
      material, taught PARACELSUS, contain the three principles termed in
      alchemistic phraseology salt, sulphur, and mercury. This is true,
      therefore, of man: the healthy body, he argued, is a sort of chemical
      compound in which these three principles are harmoniously blended (as in
      the Macrocosm) in due proportion, whilst disease is due to a preponderance
      of one principle, fevers, for example, being the result of an excess of
      sulphur (<i>i.e</i>. the fiery principle), <i>etc</i>. PARACELSUS,
      although his theory was not so different from that of GALEN, whose views
      he denounced, was thus led to seek for CHEMICAL remedies, containing these
      principles in varying proportions; he was not content with medicinal herbs
      and minerals in their crude state, but attempted to extract their
      effective essences; indeed, he maintained that the preparation of new and
      better drugs is the chief business of chemistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) See the "Note on the Paracelsian Doctrine of the Microcosm" below.
    </p>
    <p>
      This theory of disease and of the efficacy of drugs was complicated by
      many fantastic additions;(1) thus there is the "Archaeus," a sort of
      benevolent demon, supposed by PARACELSUS to look after all the unconscious
      functions of the bodily organism, who has to be taken into account.
      PARACELSUS also held the Doctrine of Signatures, according to which the
      medicinal value of plants and minerals is indicated by their external
      form, or by some sign impressed upon them by the operation of the stars. A
      very old example of this belief is to be found in the use of mandrake
      (whose roots resemble the human form) by the Hebrews and Greeks as a cure
      for sterility; or, to give an instance which is still accredited by some,
      the use of eye-bright (<i>Euphrasia officinalis</i>, L., a plant with a
      black pupil-like spot in its corolla) for complaints of the eyes.(2)
      Allied to this doctrine are such beliefs, once held, as that the lungs of
      foxes are good for bronchial troubles, or that the heart of a lion will
      endow one with courage; as CORNELIUS AGRIPPA put it, "It is well known
      amongst physicians that brain helps the brain, and lungs the lungs."(3)
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) The question of PARACELSUS' pharmacy is further complicated by the
      fact that this eccentric genius coined many new words (without regard to
      the principles of etymology) as names for his medicines, and often used
      the same term to stand for quite different bodies. Some of his disciples
      maintained that he must not always be understood in a literal sense, in
      which probably there is an element of truth. See, for instance, <i>A
      Golden and Blessed Casket of Nature's Marvels</i>, by BENEDICTUS FIGULUS
      (trans. by A. E. WAITE, 1893).

    </p>
    <p>
      In modern times homoeopathy&mdash;according to which a drug is a cure, if
      administered in small doses, for that disease whose symptoms it produces,
      if given in large doses to a healthy person&mdash;-seems to bear some
      resemblance to these old medical theories concerning the curing of like by
      like. That the system of HAHNEMANN (1755&mdash;1843), the founder of
      homoeopathy, is free from error could be scarcely maintained, but certain
      recent discoveries in connection with serum-therapy appear to indicate
      that the last word has not yet been said on the subject, and the formula
      "like cures like" may still have another lease of life to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to PARACELSUS, however. It may be thought that his views were
      not so great an advance on those of GALEN; but whether or not this be the
      case, his union of chemistry and medicine was of immense benefit to each
      science, and marked a new era in pharmacy. Even if his theories were
      highly fantastic, it was he who freed medicine from the shackles of
      traditionalism, and rendered progress in medical science possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must not conclude these brief notes without some reference to the
      medical theory of the medicinal efficacy of words. The EBERS papyrus
      already mentioned gives various formulas which must be pronounced when
      preparing and when administering a drug; and there is a draught used by
      the Eastern Jews as a cure for bronchial complaints prepared by writing
      certain words on a plate, washing them off with wine, and adding three
      grains of a citron which has been used at the Tabernacle festival. But
      enough for our present excursion; we must hie us back to the modern world,
      with its alkaloids, serums, and anti-toxins&mdash;another day we will,
      perhaps, wander again down the by-paths of Medicinal Magic.

    <p>
      NOTE ON THE PARACELSIAN DOCTRINE OF THE MICROCOSM
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man's nature," writes CORNELIUS AGRIPPA, "<i>is the most complete Image
      of the whole Universe</i>."(1) This theory, especially connected with the
      name of PARACELSUS, is worthy of more than passing reference; but as the
      consideration of it leads us from medicine to metaphysics, I have thought
      it preferable to deal with the subject in a note.

    <p>
      Man, taught the old mystical philosophers, is threefold in nature,
      consisting of spirit, soul, and body. The Paracelsian mercury, sulphur,
      and salt were the mineral analogues of these. "As to the Spirit," writes
      VALENTINE WEIGEL (1533&mdash;1588), a disciple of PARACELSUS, "we are of
      God, move in God, and live in God, and are nourished of God. Hence God is
      in us and we are in God; God hath put and placed Himself in us, and we are
      put and placed in God. As to the Soul, we are from the Firmament and
      Stars, we live and move therein, and are nourished thereof. Hence the
      Firmament with its astralic virtues and operations is in us, and we in it.
      The Firmament is put and placed in us, and we are put and placed in the
      Firmament. As to the Body, we are of the elements, we move and live
      therein, and are nourished of them:&mdash;hence the elements are in us,
      and we in them. The elements, by the slime, are put and placed in us, and
      we are put and placed in them."(1) Or, to quote from PARACELSUS himself,
      in his <i>Hermetic Astronomy</i> he writes: "God took the body out of
      which He built up man from those things which He created from nothingness
      into something... Hence man is now a microcosm, or a little world, because
      he is an extract from all the stars and planets of the whole firmament,
      from the earth and the elements, and so he is their quintessence.... But
      between the macrocosm and the microcosm this difference occurs, that the
      form, image, species, and substance of man are diverse therefrom. In man
      the earth is flesh, the water is blood, fire is the heat thereof, and air
      is the balsam. These properties have not been changed but only the
      substance of the body. So man is man, not a world, yet made from the
      world, made in the likeness, not of the world, but of God. Yet man
      comprises in himself all the qualities of the world.... His body is from
      the world, and therefore must be fed and nourished by that world from
      which he has sprung.... He has been taken from the earth and from the
      elements, and therefore, must be nourished by these.... Now, man is not
      only flesh and blood, but there is within the intellect which does not,
      like the complexion, come from the elements, but from the stars. And the
      condition of the stars is this, that all the wisdom, intelligence,
      industry of the animal, and all the arts peculiar to man are contained in
      them. From the stars man has these same things, and that is called the
      light of Nature; in fact, it is whatever man has found by the light of
      Nature.... Such, then, is the condition of man, that, out of the great
      universe he needs both elements and stars, seeing that he himself is
      constituted in that way."(1b)

      It is not difficult to discern a certain truth in all this, making
      allowances for modes of thought which are not those of the present day.
      The Swedish philosopher SWEDENBORG (1688-1772) reaffirmed the theory in
      later years; but, as he points out,(2) the reason that man is a microcosm
      lies deeper than in the facts that his body is of the elements of this
      earth and is nourished thereby. According to this profound thinker, FORM,
      spiritually understood, is the expression of USE, the uses of things being
      indicated by their forms. Now, the human form is the highest of all forms,
      because it subserves the highest of all uses. Hence, both the world of
      matter and the world of spirit are in the human form, because there is a
      correspondence in use between man and the Cosmos. We may, therefore, call
      man as to his body a microcosm, or little world; as to his soul a
      micro-uranos, or little heaven. Or we may speak of the macrocosm, or great
      world, as the Grand Man, and we may say that the Soul of this Grand Man,
      the self-existent, substantial, and efficient cause of all things, at once
      immanent within yet transcending all things, is God.

    <h2>
      IV. SUPERSTITIONS CONCERNING BIRDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      AMONGST the most remarkable of natural occurrences must be included many
      of the phenomena connected with the behaviour of birds. Undoubtedly
      numerous species of birds are susceptible to atmospheric changes (of an
      electrical and barometric nature) too slight to be observed by man's
      unaided senses; thus only is to be explained the phenomenon of migration
      and also the many other peculiarities in the behaviour of birds whereby
      approaching changes in the weather may be foretold. Probably, also, this
      fact has much to do with the extraordinary homing instinct of pigeons.
      But, of course, in the days when meteorological science had yet to be
      born, no such explanation as this could be known. The ancients observed
      that birds by their migrations or by other peculiarities in their
      behaviour prognosticated coming changes in the seasons of the year and
      other changes connected with the weather (such as storms, <i>etc</i>.);
      they saw, too, in the homing instincts of pigeons an apparent exhibition
      of intelligence exceeding that of man. What more natural, then, for them
      to attribute foresight to birds, and to suppose that all sorts of coming
      events (other than those of an atmospheric nature) might be foretold by
      careful observation of their flight and song?
    </p>
    <p>
      Augury&mdash;that is, the art of divination by observing the behaviour of
      birds&mdash;was extensively cultivated by the Etrurians and Romans.(1) It
      is still used, I believe, by the natives of Samoa. The Romans had an
      official college of augurs, the members of which were originally three
      patricians. About 300 B.C. the number of patrician augurs was increased by
      one, and five plebeian augurs were added. Later the number was again
      increased to fifteen. The object of augury was not so much to foretell the
      future as to indicate what line of action should be followed, in any given
      circumstances, by the nation. The augurs were consulted on all matters of
      importance, and the position of augur was thus one of great consequence.
      In what appears to be the oldest method, the augur, arrayed in a special
      costume, and carrying a staff with which to mark out the visible heavens
      into houses, proceeded to an elevated piece of ground, where a sacrifice
      was made and a prayer repeated. Then, gazing towards the sky, he waited
      until a bird appeared. The point in the heavens where it first made its
      appearance was carefully noted, also the manner and direction of its
      flight, and the point where it was lost sight of. From these particulars
      an augury was derived, but, in order to be of effect, it had to be
      confirmed by a further one.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) This is not quite an accurate definition, as "auguries" were also
      obtained from other animals and from celestial phenomena (<i>e.g</i>.
      lightning), <i>etc</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auguries were also drawn from the notes of birds, birds being divided by
      the augurs into two classes: (i) <i>oscines</i>, "those which give omens
      by their note," and (ii) <i>alites</i>, "those which afford presages by
      their flight."(1) Another method of augury was performed by the feeding of
      chickens specially kept for this purpose. This was done just before
      sunrise by the <i>pullarius</i> or feeder, strict silence being observed.
      If the birds manifested no desire for their food, the omen was of a most
      direful nature. On the other hand, if from the greediness of the chickens
      the grain fell from their beaks and rebounded from the ground, the augury
      was most favourable. This latter augury was known as <i>tripudium
      solistimum</i>. "Any fraud practiced by the 'pullarius'," writes the Rev.
      EDWARD SMEDLEY, "reverted to his own head. Of this we have a memorable
      instance in the great battle between Papirius Cursor and the Samnites in
      the year of Rome 459. So anxious were the troops for battle, that the
      'pullarius' dared to announce to the consul a 'tripudium solistimum,'
      although the chickens refused to eat. Papirius unhesitatingly gave the
      signal for fight, when his son, having discovered the false augury,
      hastened to communicate it to his father. 'Do thy part well,' was his
      reply, 'and let the deceit of the augur fall on himself. The "tripudium"
      has been announced to me, and no omen could be better for the Roman army
      and people!' As the troops advanced, a javelin thrown at random struck the
      'pullatius' dead. 'The hand of heaven is in the battle,' cried Papirius;
      'the guilty is punished!' and he advanced and conquered."(1b) A
      coincidence of this sort, if it really occurred, would very greatly
      strengthen the popular belief in auguries.

      The <i>cock</i> has always been reckoned a bird possessed of magic power.
      At its crowing, we are told, all unquiet spirits who roam the earth depart
      to their dismal abodes, and the orgies of the Witches' Sabbath terminate.
      A cock is the favourite sacrifice offered to evil spirits in Ceylon and
      elsewhere. Alectromancy(2) was an ancient and peculiarly senseless method
      of divination (so called) in which a cock was employed. The bird had to be
      young and quite white. Its feet were cut off and crammed down its throat
      with a piece of parchment on which were written certain Hebrew words. The
      cock, after the repetition of a prayer by the operator, was placed in a
      circle divided into parts corresponding to the letters of the alphabet, in
      each of which a grain of wheat was placed. A certain psalm was recited,
      and then the letters were noted from which the cock picked up the grains,
      a fresh grain being put down for each one picked up. These letters,
      properly arranged, were said to give the answer to the inquiry for which
      divination was made. I am not sure what one was supposed to do if, as
      seems likely, the cock refused to act in the required manner.

      The <i>owl</i> was reckoned a bird of evil omen with the Romans, who
      derived this opinion from the Etrurians, along with much else of their
      so-called science of augury. It was particularly dreaded if seen in a
      city, or, indeed, anywhere by day. PLINY (Caius Plinius Secundus, A.D.
      61-before 115) informs us that on one occasion "a horned owl entered the
      very sanctuary of the Capitol;... in consequence of which, Rome was
      purified on the nones of March in that year."(1)

      The folk-lore of the British Isles abounds with quaint beliefs and stories
      concerning birds. There is a charming Welsh legend concerning the <i>robin</i>,
      which the Rev. T. F. T. DYER quotes from <i>Notes and Queries</i>:&mdash;"Far,
      far away, is a land of woe, darkness, spirits of evil, and fire. Day by
      day does this little bird bear in his bill a drop of water to quench the
      flame. So near the burning stream does he fly, that his dear little
      feathers are SCORCHED; and hence he is named Brou-rhuddyn (Breast-burnt).
      To serve little children, the robin dares approach the infernal pit. No
      good child will hurt the devoted benefactor of man. The robin returns from
      the land of fire, and therefore he feels the cold of winter far more than
      his brother birds. He shivers in the brumal blast; hungry, he chirps
      before your door."(2)

      Another legend accounts for the robin's red breast by supposing this bird
      to have tried to pluck a thorn from the crown encircling the brow of the
      crucified CHRIST, in order to alleviate His sufferings. No doubt it is on
      account of these legends that it is considered a crime, which will be
      punished with great misfortune, to kill a robin. In some places the same
      prohibition extends to the <i>wren</i>, which is popularly believed to be
      the wife of the robin. In other parts, however, the wren is (or at least
      was) cruelly hunted on certain days. In the Isle of Man the wren-hunt took
      place on Christmas Eve and St Stephen's Day, and is accounted for by a
      legend concerning an evil fairy who lured many men to destruction, but had
      to assume the form of a wren to escape punishment at the hands of an
      ingenious knight-errant.

      For several centuries there was prevalent over the whole of civilised
      Europe a most extraordinary superstition concerning the small Arctic bird
      resembling, but not so large as, the common wild goose, known as the <i>barnacle</i>
      or <i>bernicle goose</i>. MAX MUELLER(1) has suggested that this word was
      really derived from <i>Hibernicula</i>, the name thus referring to
      Ireland, where the birds were caught; but common opinion associated the
      barnacle goose with the shell-fish known as the barnacle (which is found
      on timber exposed to the sea), supposing that the former was generated out
      of the latter. Thus in one old medical writer we find: "There are founde
      in the north parts of Scotland, and the Ilands adjacent, called Orchades
      (Orkney Islands), certain trees, whereon doe growe certaine shell fishes,
      of a white colour tending to russet; wherein are conteined little liuing
      creatures: which shells in time of maturitie doe open, and out of them
      grow those little living things; which falling into the water, doe become
      foules, whom we call Barnakles... but the other that do fall vpon the
      land, perish and come to nothing: this much by the writings of others, and
      also from the mouths of the people of those parts...."(1b)

      of the barnacle goose will be found.

      The writer, however, who was a well-known surgeon and botanist of his day,
      adds that he had personally examined certain shell-fish from Lancashire,
      and on opening the shells had observed within birds in various stages of
      development. No doubt he was deceived by some purely superficial
      resemblances&mdash;for example, the feet of the barnacle fish resemble
      somewhat the feathers of a bird. He gives an imaginative illustration of
      the barnacle fowl escaping from its shell, which is reproduced in fig. 12.

      Turning now from superstitions concerning actual birds to legends of those
      that are purely mythical, passing reference must be made to the <i>roc</i>,
      a bird existing in Arabian legend, which we meet in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>,
      and which is chiefly remarkable for its size and strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>phoenix</i>, perhaps, is of more interest. Of "that famous bird of
      Arabia," PLINY writes as follows, prefixing his description of it with the
      cautious remark, "I am not quite sure that its existence is not all a
      fable." "It is said that there is only one in existence in the whole
      world, and that that one has not been seen very often. We are told that
      this bird is of the size of an eagle, and has a brilliant golden plumage
      around the neck, while the rest of the body is of a purple colour; except
      the tail, which is azure, with long feathers intermingled of a roseate
      hue; the throat is adorned with a crest, and the head with a tuft of
      feathers. The first Roman who described this bird... was the senator
      Manilius.... He tells us that no person has ever seen this bird eat, that
      in Arabia it is looked upon as sacred to the sun, that it lives five
      hundred and forty years, that when it becomes old it builds a nest of
      cassia and sprigs of incense, which it fills with perfumes, and then lays
      its body down upon them to die; that from its bones and marrow there
      springs at first a sort of small worm, which in time changes into a little
      bird; that the first thing that it does is to perform the obsequies of its
      predecessor, and to carry the nest entire to the city of the Sun near
      Panchaia, and there deposit it upon the altar of that divinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same Manilius states also, that the revolution of the great year is
      completed with the life of this bird, and that then a new cycle comes
      round again with the same characteristics as the former one, in the
      seasons and the appearance of the stars. ... This bird was brought to Rome
      in the censorship of the Emperor Claudius... and was exposed to public
      view.... This fact is attested by the public Annals, but there is no one
      that doubts that it was a fictitious phoenix only."(1)

      trans., vol. ii., 1855, PP. 479-481).
    </p>
    <p>
      The description of the plumage, <i>etc</i>., of this bird applies fairly
      well, as CUVIER has pointed out,(2) to the golden pheasant, and a specimen
      of the latter may have been the "fictitious phoenix" referred to above.
      That this bird should have been credited with the extraordinary and wholly
      fabulous properties related by PLINY and others is not, however, easy to
      understand. The phoenix was frequently used to illustrate the doctrine of
      the immortality of the soul (<i>e.g</i>. in CLEMENT'S <i>First Epistle to
      the Corinthians</i>), and it is not impossible that originally it was
      nothing more than a symbol of immortality which in time became to be
      believed in as a really existing bird. The fact, however, that there was
      supposed to be only one phoenix, and also that the length of each of its
      lives coincided with what the ancients termed a "great year," may indicate
      that the phoenix was a symbol of cosmological periodicity. On the other
      hand, some ancient writers (e<i>.g</i>. TACITUS, A.D. 55-120) explicitly
      refer to the phoenix as a symbol of the sun, and in the minds of the
      ancients the sun was closely connected with the idea of immortality.
      Certainly the accounts of the gorgeous colours of the plumage of the
      phoenix might well be descriptions of the rising sun. It appears,
      moreover, that the Egyptian hieroglyphic <i>benu</i>, {glyph}, which is a
      figure of a heron or crane (and thus akin to the phoenix), was employed to
      designate the rising sun.

    </p>
    <p>
      There are some curious Jewish legends to account for the supposed
      immortality of the phoenix. According to one, it was the sole animal that
      refused to eat of the forbidden tree when tempted by EVE. According to
      another, its immortality was conferred on it by NOAH because of its
      considerate behaviour in the Ark, the phoenix not clamouring for food like
      the other animals.(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) The existence of such fables as these shows how grossly the real
      meanings of the Sacred Writings have been misunderstood.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a celebrated bird in Chinese tradition, the <i>Fung Hwang</i>,
      which some sinologues identify with the phoenix of the West.(2) According
      to a commentator on the '<i>Rh Ya</i>, this "felicitous and perfect bird
      has a cock's head, a snake's neck, a swallow's beak, a tortoise's back, is
      of five different colours and more than six feet high."
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) Mr CHAS. GOULD, B.A., to whose book <i>Mythical Monsters</i> (1886) I
      am very largely indebted for my account of this bird, and from which I
      have culled extracts from the Chinese, is not of this opinion. Certainly
      the fact that we read of Fung Hwangs in the plural, whilst tradition
      asserts that there is only one phoenix, seems to point to a difference in
      origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another account (that in the <i>Lun Yu Tseh Shwai Shing</i>) tells us that
      "its head resembles heaven, its eye the sun, its back the moon, its wings
      the wind, its foot the ground, and its tail the woof." Furthermore, "its
      mouth contains commands, its heart is conformable to regulations, its ear
      is thoroughly acute in hearing, its tongue utters sincerity, its colour is
      luminous, its comb resembles uprightness, its spur is sharp and curved,
      its voice is sonorous, and its belly is the treasure of literature." Like
      the dragon, tortoise, and unicorn, it was considered to be a spiritual
      creature; but, unlike the Western phoenix, more than one Fung Hwang was,
      as I have pointed out, believed to exist. The birds were not always to be
      seen, but, according to Chinese records, they made their appearance during
      the reigns of certain sovereigns. The Fung Hwang is regarded by the
      Chinese as an omen of great happiness and prosperity, and its likeness is
      embroidered on the robes of empresses to ensure success. Probably, if the
      bird is not to be regarded as purely mythological and symbolic in origin,
      we have in the stories of it no more than exaggerated accounts of some
      species of pheasant. Japanese literature contains similar stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of other fabulous bird-forms mention may be made of the <i>griffin</i> and
      the <i>harpy</i>. The former was a creature half eagle, half lion,
      popularly supposed to be the progeny of the union of these two latter. It
      is described in the so-called <i>Voiage and Travaile of Sir</i> JOHN
      MAUNDEVILLE in the following terms(1): "Sum men seyn, that thei ben the
      Body upward, as an Egle, and benethe as a Lyoun: and treuly thei seyn
      sothe, that thei ben of that schapp. But o Griffoun hathe the body more
      gret and is more strong thanne 8 Lyouns, of suche Lyouns as ben o this
      half; and more gret and strongere, than an 100 Egles, suche as we ben
      amonges us. For o Griffoun there will bere, fleynge to his Nest, a gret
      Hors, or 2 Oxen zoked to gidere, as thei gon at the Plowghe. For he hathe
      his Talouns so longe and so large and grete, upon his Feet, as thoughe
      thei weren Hornes of grete Oxen or of Bugles or of Kyzn; so that men maken
      Cuppes of hem, to drynken of: and of hire Ribbes and of the Pennes of hire
      Wenges, men maken Bowes fulle strong, to schote with Arwes and Quarelle."
      The special characteristic of the griffin was its watchfulness, its chief
      function being thought to be that of guarding secret treasure. This
      characteristic, no doubt, accounts for its frequent use in heraldry as a
      supporter to the arms. It was sacred to APOLLO, the sun-god, whose chariot
      was, according to early sculptures, drawn by griffins. PLINY, who speaks
      of it as a bird having long ears and a hooked beak, regarded it as
      fabulous.

      We meet with the harpies in the story of PHINEUS, a son of AGENOR, King of
      Thrace. At the bidding of his jealous wife, IDAEA, daughter of DARDANUS,
      PHINEUS put out the sight of his children by his former wife, CLEOPATRA,
      daughter of BOREAS. To punish this cruelty, the gods caused him to become
      blind, and the harpies were sent continually to harass and affright him,
      and to snatch away his food or defile it by their presence. They were
      afterwards driven away by his brothers-in-law, ZETES and CALAIS. It has
      been suggested that originally the harpies were nothing more than
      personifications of the swift storm-winds; and few of the old naturalists,
      credulous as they were, regarded them as real creatures, though this
      cannot be said of all. Some other fabulous bird-forms are to be met with
      in Greek and Arabian mythologies, <i>etc</i>., but they are not of any
      particular interest. And it is time for us to conclude our present
      excursion, and to seek for other byways.

    <h2>
      V. THE POWDER OF SYMPATHY: A CURIOUS MEDICAL SUPERSTITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      OUT of the superstitions of the past the science of the present has
      gradually evolved. In the Middle Ages, what by courtesy we may term
      medical science was, as we have seen, little better than a heterogeneous
      collection of superstitions, and although various reforms were instituted
      with the passing of time, superstition still continued for long to play a
      prominent part in medical practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most curious of these old medical (or perhaps I should say
      surgical) superstitions was that relating to the Powder of Sympathy, a
      remedy (?) chiefly remembered in connection with the name of Sir KENELM
      DIGBY (1603-1665), though he was probably not the first to employ it. The
      Powder itself, which was used as a cure for wounds, was, in fact, nothing
      else than common vitriol,(1) though an improved and more elegant form (if
      one may so describe it) was composed of vitriol desiccated by the sun's
      rays, mixed with <i>gum tragacanth</i>. It was in the application of the
      Powder that the remedy was peculiar. It was not, as one might expect,
      applied to the wound itself, but any article that might have blood from
      the wound upon it was either sprinkled with the Powder or else placed in a
      basin of water in which the Powder had been dissolved, and maintained at a
      temperate heat. Meanwhile, the wound was kept clean and cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) Green vitriol, ferrous sulphate heptahydrate, a compound of iron,
      sulphur, and oxygen, crystallised with seven molecules of water,
      represented by the formula FeSO4[.]7H2O. On exposure to the air it loses
      water, and is gradually converted into basic ferric sulphate. For long,
      green vitriol was confused with blue vitriol, which generally occurs as an
      impurity in crude green vitriol. Blue vitriol is copper sulphate
      pentahydrate, CuSO4[.]5H2O.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir KENELM DIGBY appears to have delivered a discourse dealing with the
      famous Powder before a learned assembly at Montpellier in France; at least
      a work purporting to be a translation of such a discourse was published in
      1658,(1) and further editions appeared in 1660 and 1664. KENELM was a son
      of the Sir EVERARD DIGBY (1578-1606) who was executed for his share in the
      Gunpowder Plot. In spite of this fact, however, JAMES I. appears to have
      regarded him with favour. He was a man of romantic temperament, possessed
      of charming manners, considerable learning, and even greater credulity.
      His contemporaries seem to have differed in their opinions concerning him.
      EVELYN (1620-1706), the diarist, after inspecting his chemical laboratory,
      rather harshly speaks of him as "an errant mountebank". Elsewhere he well
      refers to him as "a teller of strange things"&mdash;this was on the
      occasion of DIGBY'S relating a story of a lady who had such an aversion to
      roses that one laid on her cheek produced a blister!
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) <i>A late Discourse... by Sir</i> KENELM DIGBY, <i>Kt.&amp;c. Touching
      the Cure of Wounds by the Powder of Sympathy...rendered... out of French
      into English by</i> R. WHITE, Gent. (1658). This is entitled the second
      edition, but appears to have been the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to the <i>Late Discourse</i>: after some preliminary remarks,
      Sir KENELM records a cure which he claims to have effected by means of the
      Powder. It appears that JAMES HOWELL (1594-1666, afterwards
      historiographer royal to CHARLES II.), had, in the attempt to separate two
      friends engaged in a duel, received two serious wounds in the hand. To
      proceed in the writer's own words:&mdash;"It was my chance to be lodged
      hard by him; and four or five days after, as I was making myself ready, he
      (Mr Howell) came to my House, and prayed me to view his wounds; for I
      understand, said he, that you have extraordinary remedies upon such
      occasions, and my Surgeons apprehend some fear, that it may grow to a
      Gangrene, and so the hand must be cut off....
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked him then for any thing that had the blood upon it, so he
      presently sent for his Garter, wherewith his hand was first bound: and
      having called for a Bason of water, as if I would wash my hands; I took an
      handfull of Powder of Vitrol, which I had in my study, and presently
      dissolved it. As soon as the bloody garter was brought me, I put it within
      the Bason, observing in the interim what Mr <i>Howel</i> did, who stood
      talking with a Gentleman in the corner of my Chamber, not regarding at all
      what I was doing: but he started suddenly, as if he had found some strange
      alteration in himself; I asked him what he ailed? I know not what ailes
      me, but I find that I feel no more pain, methinks that a pleasing kind of
      freshnesse, as it were a wet cold Napkin did spread over my hand, which
      hath taken away the inflammation that tormented me before; I replied,
      since that you feel already so good an effect of my medicament, I advise
      you to cast away all your Plaisters, onely keep the wound clean, and in a
      moderate temper 'twixt heat and cold. This was presently reported to the
      Duke of <i>Buckingham</i>, and a little after to the King (James I.), who
      were both very curious to know the issue of the businesse, which was, that
      after dinner I took the garter out of the water, and put it to dry before
      a great fire; it was scarce dry, but Mr <i>Howels</i> servant came running
      (and told me), that his Master felt as much burning as ever he had done,
      if not more, for the heat was such, as if his hand were betwixt coales of
      fire: I answered, that although that had happened at present, yet he
      should find ease in a short time; for I knew the reason of this new
      accident, and I would provide accordingly, for his Master should be free
      from that inflammation, it may be, before he could possibly return unto
      him: but in case he found no ease, I wished him to come presently back
      again, if not he might forbear coming. Thereupon he went, and at the
      instant I did put again the garter into the water; thereupon he found his
      Master without any pain at all. To be brief, there was no sense of pain
      afterward: but within five or six dayes the wounds were cicatrized, and
      entirely healed."(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) <i>Ibid</i>., pp. 7-11.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir KENELM proceeds, in this discourse, to relate that he obtained the
      secret of the Powder from a Carmelite who had learnt it in the East. Sir
      KENELM says that he told it only to King JAMES and his celebrated
      physician, Sir THEODORE MAYERNE (1573-1655). The latter disclosed it to
      the Duke of MAYERNE, whose surgeon sold the secret to various persons,
      until ultimately, as Sir KENELM remarks, it became known to every country
      barber. However, DIGBY'S real connection with the Powder has been
      questioned. In an Appendix to Dr NATHANAEL HIGHMORE'S (1613-1685) <i>The
      History of Generation</i>, published in 1651, entitled <i>A Discourse of
      the Cure of Wounds by Sympathy</i>, the Powder is referred to as Sir
      GILBERT TALBOT'S Powder; nor does it appear to have been DIGBY who brought
      the claims of the Sympathetic Powder before the notice of the then
      recently-formed Royal Society, although he was a by no means inactive
      member of the Society. HIGHMORE, however, in the Appendix to the work
      referred to above, does refer to DIGBY'S reputed cure of HOWELL'S wounds
      already mentioned; and after the publication of DIGBY'S <i>Discourse</i>
      the Powder became generally known as Sir KENELM DIGBY'S Sympathetic
      Powder. As such it is referred to in an advertisement appended to <i>Wit
      and Drollery</i> (1661) by the bookseller, NATHANAEL BROOK.(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) This advertisement is as follows: "These are to give notice, that Sir
      <i>Kenelme Digbies</i> Sympathetical Powder prepar'd by Promethean fire,
      curing all green wounds that come within the compass of a Remedy; and
      likewise the Tooth-ache infallibly in a very short time: Is to be had at
      Mr <i>Nathanael Brook's</i> at the Angel in <i>Cornhil</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The belief in cure by sympathy, however, is much older than DIGBY'S or
      TALBOT'S Sympathetic Powder. PARACELSUS described an ointment consisting
      essentially of the moss on the skull of a man who had died a violent
      death, combined with boar's and bear's fat, burnt worms, dried boar's
      brain, red sandal-wood and mummy, which was used to cure (?) wounds in a
      similar manner, being applied to the weapon with which the hurt had been
      inflicted. With reference to this ointment, readers will probably recall
      the passage in SCOTT'S <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i> (canto 3, stanza
      23), respecting the magical cure of WILLIAM of DELORAINE'S wound by "the
      Ladye of Branksome":&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "She drew the splinter from the wound
  And with a charm she stanch'd the blood;
  She bade the gash be cleans'd and bound:
  No longer by his couch she stood;
  But she had ta'en the broken lance,
  And washed it from the clotted gore
  And salved the splinter o'er and o'er.
  William of Deloraine, in trance,
  Whene'er she turned it round and round,
  Twisted as if she gall'd his wound.
  Then to her maidens she did say
  That he should be whole man and sound
  Within the course of a night and day.
  Full long she toil'd; for she did rue
  Mishap to friend so stout and true."

      FRANCIS BACON (1561-1626) writes of sympathetic cures as follows:&mdash;"It
      is constantly Received, and Avouched, that the <i>Anointing</i> of the <i>Weapon</i>,
      that maketh the <i>Wound</i>, wil heale the <i>Wound</i> it selfe. In this
      <i>Experiment</i>, upon the Relation of <i>Men of Credit</i>, (though my
      selfe, as yet, am not fully inclined to beleeve it,) you shal note the <i>Points</i>
      following; First, the <i>Ointment</i>... is made of Divers <i>ingredients</i>;
      whereof the Strangest and Hardest to come by, are the Mosse upon the <i>Skull</i>
      of a <i>dead Man, Vnburied</i>; And the <i>Fats</i> of a <i>Boare</i>, and
      a <i>Beare</i>, killed in the <i>Act of Generation</i>. These Two last I
      could easily suspect to be prescribed as a Starting Hole; That if the <i>Experiment</i>
      proved not, it mought be pretended, that the <i>Beasts</i> were not killed
      in due Time; For as for the <i>Mosse</i>, it is certain there is great
      Quantity of it in <i>Ireland</i>, upon <i>Slain Bodies</i>, laid on <i>Heaps,
      Vnburied</i>. The other <i>Ingredients</i> are, the <i>Bloud-Stone</i> in
      <i>Powder</i>, and some other <i>Things</i>, which seeme to have a <i>Vertue</i>
      to <i>Stanch Bloud</i>; As also the <i>Mosse</i> hath.... Secondly, the
      same <i>kind</i> of <i>Ointment</i>, applied to the Hurt it selfe, worketh
      not the <i>Effect</i>; but onely applied to the <i>Weapon</i>.....
      Fourthly, it may be applied to the <i>Weapon</i>, though the Party Hurt be
      at a great Distance. Fifthly, it seemeth the <i>Imagination</i> of the
      Party, to be <i>Cured</i>, is not needfull to Concurre; For it may be done
      without the knowledge of the <i>Party Wounded</i>; And thus much hath been
      tried, that the <i>Ointment</i> (for <i>Experiments</i> sake,) hath been
      wiped off the <i>Weapon</i>, without the knowledge of the <i>Party Hurt</i>,
      and presently the <i>Party Hurt</i>, hath been in great <i>Rage of Paine</i>,
      till the <i>Weapon</i> was <i>Reannointed</i>. Sixthly, it is affirmed,
      that if you cannot get the <i>Weapon</i>, yet if you put an <i>Instrument</i>
      of <i>Iron</i>, or <i>Wood</i>, resembling the <i>Weapon</i>, into the <i>Wound</i>,
      whereby it bleedeth, the <i>Annointing</i> of that <i>Instrument</i> will
      serve, and work the <i>Effect</i>. This I doubt should be a Device, to
      keep this strange <i>Forme of Cure</i>, in Request, and Use; Because many
      times you cannot come by the <i>Weapon</i> it selve. Seventhly, the <i>Wound</i>
      be at first <i>Washed clean</i> with <i>White Wine</i> or the <i>Parties</i>
      own <i>Water</i>; And then bound up close in <i>Fine Linen</i> and no more
      <i>Dressing</i> renewed, till it be <i>whole</i>."(1)

      Owing to the demand for making this ointment, quite a considerable trade
      was done in skulls from Ireland upon which moss had grown owing to their
      exposure to the atmosphere, high prices being obtained for fine specimens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea underlying the belief in the efficacy of sympathetic remedies,
      namely, that by acting on part of a thing or on a symbol of it, one
      thereby acts magically on the whole or the thing symbolised, is the
      root-idea of all magic, and is of extreme antiquity. DIGBY and others,
      however, tried to give a natural explanation to the supposed efficacy of
      the Powder. They argued that particles of the blood would ascend from the
      bloody cloth or weapon, only coming to rest when they had reached their
      natural home in the wound from which they had originally issued. These
      particles would carry with them the more volatile part of the vitriol,
      which would effect a cure more readily than when combined with the grosser
      part of the vitriol. In the days when there was hardly any knowledge of
      chemistry and physics, this theory no doubt bore every semblance of truth.
      In passing, however, it is interesting to note that DIGBY'S <i>Discourse</i>
      called forth a reply from J. F. HELVETIUS (or SCHWETTZER, 1625-1709),
      physician to the Prince of Orange, who afterwards became celebrated as an
      alchemist who had achieved the magnum opus.(1)

    </p>
    <p>
      Writing of the Sympathetic Powder, Professor DE MORGAN wittily argues that
      it must have been quite efficacious. He says: "The directions were to keep
      the wound clean and cool, and to take care of diet, rubbing the salve on
      the knife or sword. If we remember the dreadful notions upon drugs which
      prevailed, both as to quantity and quality, we shall readily see that any
      way of NOT dressing the wound would have been useful. If the physicians
      had taken the hint, had been careful of diet, <i>etc</i>., and had poured
      the little barrels of medicine down the throat of a practicable doll, THEY
      would have had their magical cures as well as the surgeons."(2) As Dr
      PETTIGREW has pointed out,(3) Nature exhibits very remarkable powers in
      effecting the healing of wounds by adhesion, when her processes are not
      impeded. In fact, many cases have been recorded in which noses, ears, and
      fingers severed from the body have been rejoined thereto, merely by
      washing the parts, placing them in close continuity, and allowing the
      natural powers of the body to effect the healing. Moreover, in spite of
      BACON'S remarks on this point, the effect of the imagination of the
      patient, who was usually not ignorant that a sympathetic cure was to be
      attempted, must be taken into account; for, without going to the excesses
      of "Christian Science" in this respect, the fact must be recognised that
      the state of the mind exercises a powerful effect on the natural forces of
      the body, and a firm faith is undoubtedly helpful in effecting the cure of
      any sort of ill.

      VI. THE BELIEF IN TALISMANS
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE word "talisman" is derived from the Arabic "tilsam," "a magical
      image," through the plural form "tilsamen." This Arabic word is itself
      probably derived from the Greek telesma in its late meaning of "a
      religious mystery" or "consecrated object". The term is often employed to
      designate amulets in general, but, correctly speaking, it has a more
      restricted and special significance. A talisman may be defined briefly as
      an astrological or other symbol expressive of the influence and power of
      one of the planets, engraved on a sympathetic stone or metal (or inscribed
      on specially prepared parchment) under the auspices of this planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before proceeding to an account of the preparation of talismans proper, it
      will not be out of place to notice some of the more interesting and
      curious of other amulets. All sorts of substances have been employed as
      charms, sometimes of a very unpleasant nature, such as dried toads.
      Generally, however, amulets consist of stones, herbs, or passages from
      Sacred Writings written on paper. This latter class are sometimes called
      "characts," as an example of which may be mentioned the Jewish
      phylacteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every precious stone was supposed to exercise its own peculiar virtue; for
      instance, amber was regarded as a good remedy for throat troubles, and
      agate was thought to preserve from snake-bites. ELIHU RICH(1) gives a very
      full list of stones and their supposed virtues. Each sign of the zodiac
      was supposed to have its own particular stone(2) (as shown in the annexed
      table), and hence the superstitious though not inartistic custom of
      wearing one's birth-

      stone for "luck". The belief in the occult powers of certain stones is by
      no means non-existent at the present day; for even in these enlightened
      times there are not wanting those who fear the beautiful opal, and put
      their faith in the virtues of New Zealand green-stone.

    <p>
      (2) With regard to these stones, however, there is much confusion and
      difference of opinion. The arrangement adopted in the table here given is
      that of CORNELIUS AGRIPPA (<i>Occult Philosophy</i>, bk. ii.). A
      comparatively recent work, esteemed by modern occultists, namely, <i>The
      Light of Egypt, or the Science of the Soul and the Stars</i> (1889), gives
      the following scheme:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      {}=Amethyst. {}=Emerald. {}=Diamond. {}=Onyx (Chalcedony).
    </p>
    <p>
      {}=Agate. {}=Ruby. {}=Topaz. {}=Sapphire (skyblue).
    </p>
    <p>
      {}=Beryl. {}=Jasper. {}=Carbuncle. {}=Chrysolite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common superstitious opinion regarding birth-stones, as reflected, for
      example, in the "lucky birth charms" exhibited in the windows of the
      jewellers' shops, considerably diverges in this matter from the views of
      both these authorities. The usual scheme is as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Jan.=Garnet.       May =Emerald.    Sept.=Sapphire,
 Feb.=Amethyst.     June=Agate.      Oct. =Opal.
 Mar.=Bloodstone.   July=Ruby.       Nov. =Topaz.
 Apr.=Diamond.      Aug.=Sardonyx.   Dec. =Turquoise.
</pre>
    <p>
      The bloodstone is frequently assigned either to Aries or Scorpio, owing to
      its symbolical connection with Mars; and the opal to Cancer, which in
      astrology is the constellation of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confusion is rendered still worse by the fact that the ancients whilst in
      some cases using the same names as ourselves, applied them to different
      stones; thus their "hyacinth" is our "sapphire," whilst their "sapphire"
      is our "lapis lazuli".
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain herbs, culled at favourable conjunctions of the planets and worn
      as amulets, were held to be very efficacious against various diseases.
      Precious stones and metals were also taken internally for the same purpose&mdash;"remedies"
      which in certain cases must have proved exceedingly harmful. One theory
      put forward for the supposed medical value of amulets was the Doctrine of
      Effluvia. This theory supposes the amulets to give off vapours or effluvia
      which penetrate into the body and effect a cure. It is, of course, true
      that certain herbs, <i>etc</i>., might, under the heat of the body, give
      off such effluvia, but the theory on the whole is manifestly absurd. The
      Doctrine of Signatures, which we have already encountered in our
      excursions,(1) may also be mentioned in this connection as a complementary
      and equally untenable hypothesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to ELIHU RICH,(2) the following were the commonest Egyptian
      amulets:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Those inscribed with the figure of <i>Serapis</i>, used to preserve
      against evils inflicted by earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Figure of <i>Canopus</i>, against evil by water.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Figure of a <i>hawk</i>, against evil from the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Figure of an <i>asp</i>, against evil by fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARACELSUS believed there to be much occult virtue in an alloy of the
      seven chief metals, which he called <i>Electrum</i>. Certain definite
      proportions of these metals had to be taken, and each was to be added
      during a favourable conjunction of the planets. From this electrum he
      supposed that valuable amulets and magic mirrors could be prepared.

      A curious and ancient amulet for the cure of various diseases,
      particularly the ague, was a triangle formed of the letters of the word
      "Abracadabra." The usual form was that shown in fig. 19, and that shown in
      fig. 20 was also known. The origin of this magical word is lost in
      obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The belief in the horn as a powerful amulet, especially prevalent in
      Italy, where is it the custom of the common people to make the sign of the
      <i>mano cornuto</i> to avoid the consequence of the dreaded <i>jettatore</i>
      or evil eye, can be traced to the fact that the horn was the symbol of the
      Goddess of the Moon. Probably the belief in the powers of the horse-shoe
      had a similar origin. Indeed, it seems likely that not only this, but most
      other amulets, like talismans proper&mdash;as will appear below,&mdash;were
      originally designed as appeals to gods and other powerful spiritual
      beings.

      To turn our attention, however, to the art of preparing talismans proper:
      I may remark at the outset that it was necessary for the talisman to be
      prepared by one's own self&mdash;a task by no means easy as a rule.
      Indeed, the right mental attitude of the occultist was insisted upon as
      essential to the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the various signs to be engraver on the talismans, various
      authorities differ, though there are certain points connected with the art
      of talismanic magic on which they all agree. It so happened that the
      ancients were acquainted with seven metals and seven planets (including
      the sun and moon as planets), and the days of the week are also seven. It
      was concluded, therefore, that there was some occult connection between
      the planets, metals, and days of the week. Each of the seven days of the
      week was supposed to be under the auspices of the spirits of one of the
      planets; so also was the generation in the womb of Nature of each of the
      seven chief metals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following table are shown these particulars in detail:&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      Consequently, the metal of which a talisman was to be made, and also the
      time of its preparation, had to be chosen with due regard to the planet
      under which it was to be prepared.(1) The power of such a talisman was
      thought to be due to the genie of this planet&mdash;a talisman, was, in
      fact, a silent evocation of an astral spirit. Examples of the belief that
      a genie can be bound up in an amulet in some way are afforded by the story
      of ALADDIN'S lamp and ring and other stories in the <i>Thousand and One
      Nights</i>. Sometimes the talismanic signs were engraved on precious
      stones, sometimes they were inscribed on parchment; in both cases the same
      principle held good, the nature of the stone chosen, or the colour of the
      ink employed, being that in correspondence with the planet under whose
      auspices the talisman was prepared.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
(1) In this connection a rather surprising discovery made by Mr W.
GORNOLD (see his <i>A Manual of Occultism</i>, 1911, pp. 7 and 8) must be
mentioned. The ancient Chaldeans appear invariably to have enumerated
the planets in the following order: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus,
Mercury, Moon&mdash;which order was adopted by the mediaeval astrologers.
Let us commence with the Sun in the above sequence, and write down every
third planet; we then have&mdash;          Sun .   .   .   . Sunday.
          Moon.   .   .   . Monday.
          Mars.   .   .   . Tuesday.
          Mercury. .   .   . Wednesday.
          Jupiter..   .   . Thursday.
          Venus.  .   .   . Friday.
          Saturn. .   .   . Saturday.
</pre>
    <p>
      That is to say, we have the planets in the order in which they were
      supposed to rule over the days of the week. This is perhaps, not so
      surprising, because it seems probable that, each day being first divided
      into twenty-four hours, it was assumed that the planets ruled for one hour
      in turn, in the order first mentioned above. Each day was then named after
      the planet which ruled during its first hour. It will be found that if we
      start with the Sun and write down every twenty-fourth planet, the result
      is exactly the same as if we write down every third. But Mr OLD points out
      further, doing so by means of a diagram which seems to be rather
      cumbersome that if we start with Saturn in the first place, and write down
      every fifth planet, and then for each planet substitute the metal over
      which it was supposed to rule, we then have these metals arranged in
      descending order of atomic weights, thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Saturn   .   .   . Lead (=207).
     Mercury  .   .   . Mercury (=200).
     Sun.    .   .   . Gold (=197).
     Jupiter  .   .   . Tin (=119).
     Moon.   .   .   . Silver (=108).
     Venus         .   . Copper (=64).
     Mars.   .   .   . Iron (=56).
</pre>
    <p>
      Similarly we can, starting from any one of these orders, pass to the other
      two. The fact is a very surprising one, because the ancients could not
      possibly have been acquainted with the atomic weights of the metals, and,
      it is important to note, the order of the densities of these metals, which
      might possibly have been known to them, is by no means the same as the
      order of their atomic weights. Whether the fact indicates a real
      relationship between the planets and the metals, or whether there is some
      other explanation, I am not prepared to say. Certainly some explanation is
      needed: to say that the fact is mere coincidence is unsatisfactory, seeing
      that the odds against, not merely this, but any such regularity occurring
      by chance&mdash;as calculated by the mathematical theory of probability&mdash;are
      119 to 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the instruments employed in the art had to be specially prepared and
      consecrated. Special robes had to be worn, perfumes and incense burnt, and
      invocations, conjurations, <i>etc</i>., recited, all of which depended on
      the planet ruling the operation. A description of a few typical talismans
      in detail will not here be out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <i>The Key of Solomon the King</i> (translated by S. L. M. MATHERS,
      1889)(1) are described five, six, or seven talismans for each planet. Each
      of these was supposed to have its own peculiar virtues, and many of them
      are stated to be of use in the evocation of spirits. The majority of them
      consist of a central design encircled by a verse of Hebrew Scripture. The
      central designs are of a varied character, generally geometrical figures
      and Hebrew letters or words, or magical characters. Five of these
      talismans are here portrayed, the first three described differing from the
      above. The translations of the Hebrew verses, <i>etc</i>., given below are
      due to Mr MATHERS.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) The <i>Clavicula Salomonis</i>, or <i>Key of Solomon the King</i>,
      consists mainly of an elaborate ritual for the evocation of the various
      planetary spirits, in which process the use of talismans or pentacles
      plays a prominent part. It is claimed to be a work of white magic, but,
      inasmuch as it, like other old books making the same claim, gives
      descriptions of a pentacle for causing ruin, destruction, and death, and
      another for causing earthquakes&mdash;to give only two examples,&mdash;the
      distinction between black and white magic, which we shall no doubt
      encounter again in later excursions, appears to be somewhat arbitrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the authorship of the work, Mr MATHERS, translator and editor of
      the first printed copy of the book, says, "I see no reason to doubt the
      tradition which assigns the authorship of the 'Key' to King Solomon." If
      this view be accepted, however, it is abundantly evident that the <i>Key</i>
      as it stands at present (in which we find S. JOHN quoted, and mention made
      of SS. PETER and PAUL) must have received some considerable alterations
      and additions at the hands of later editors. But even if we are compelled
      to assign the <i>Clavicula Salomonis</i> in its present form to the
      fourteenth or fifteenth century, we must, I think, allow that it was based
      upon traditions of the past, and, of course, the possibility remains that
      it might have been based upon some earlier work. With regard to the
      antiquity of the planetary sigils, Mr MATHERS notes "that, among the
      Gnostic talismans in the British Museum, there is a ring of copper with
      the sigils of Venus, which are exactly the same as those given by
      mediaeval writers on magic."
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the absurdity of its claims, viewed in the light of modern
      knowledge, the <i>Clavicula Salomonis</i> exercised a considerable
      influence in the past, and is to be regarded as one of the chief sources
      of mediaeval ceremonial magic. Historically speaking, therefore, it is a
      book of no little importance.

      <i>The First Pentacle of the Sun</i>.&mdash;"The Countenance of Shaddai
      the Almighty, at Whose aspect all creatures obey, and the Angelic Spirits
      do reverence on bended knees." About the face is the name "El Shaddai".
      Around is written in Latin: "Behold His face and form by Whom all things
      were made, and Whom all creatures obey" (see fig. 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Fifth Pentacle of Mars</i>.&mdash;"Write thou this Pentacle upon
      virgin parchment or paper because it is terrible unto the Demons, and at
      its sight and aspect they will obey thee, for they cannot resist its
      presence." The design is a Scorpion,(1) around which the word Hvl is
      repeated. The Hebrew versicle is from <i>Psalm</i> xci. 13: "Thou shalt go
      upon the lion and adder, the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread
      under thy feet" (see fig. 22).
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) In astrology the zodiacal sign of the scorpion is the "night house" of
      the planet Mars.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Third Pentacle of the Moon</i>.&mdash;"This being duly borne with
      thee when upon a journey, if it be properly made, serveth against all
      attacks by night, and against every kind of danger and peril by Water."
      The design consists of a hand and sleeved forearm (this occurs on three
      other moon talismans), together with the Hebrew names Aub and Vevaphel.
      The versicle is from <i>Psalm</i> xl. 13: "Be pleased O IHVH to deliver
      me, O IHVH make haste to help me" (see fig 23)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Third Pentacle of Venus</i>.&mdash;"This, if it be only shown unto
      any person, serveth to attract love. Its Angel Monachiel should be invoked
      in the day and hour of Venus, at one o'clock or at eight." The design
      consists of two triangles joined at their apices, with the following names&mdash;IHVH,
      Adonai, Ruach, Achides, AEgalmiel, Monachiel, and Degaliel. The versicle
      is from <i>Genesis</i> i. 28: "And the Elohim blessed them, and the Elohim
      said unto them, Be ye fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and
      subdue it" (see fig. 24).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Third Pentacle of Mercury</i>.&mdash;"This serves to invoke the
      Spirits subject unto Mercury; and especially those who are written in this
      Pentacle." The design consists of crossed lines and magical characters of
      Mercury. Around are the names of the angels, Kokaviel, Ghedoriah,
      Savaniah, and Chokmahiel (see fig. 25).

    <p>
      CORNELIUS AGRIPPA, in his <i>Three Books of Occult Philosophy</i>,
      describes another interesting system of talismans. FRANCIS BARRETT'S <i>Magus,
      or Celestial Intelligencer</i>, a well-known occult work published in the
      first year of the nineteenth century, I may mention, copies AGRIPPA'S
      system of talismans, without acknowledgment, almost word for word. To each
      of the planets is assigned a magic square or table, <i>i.e</i>. a square
      composed of numbers so arranged that the sum of each row or column is
      always the same. For example, the table for Mars is as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     11   24   7    20   3
     4    12   25   8    16
     17   5    13   21   9
     10   18   1    14   22
     23   6    19   2    15
</pre>
    <p>
      It will be noticed that every number from 1 up to the highest possible
      occurs once, and that no number occurs twice. It will also be seen that
      the sum of each row and of each column is always 65. Similar squares can
      be constructed containing any square number of figures, and it is, indeed,
      by no means surprising that the remarkable properties of such "magic
      squares," before these were explained mathematically, gave rise to the
      belief that they had some occult significance and virtue. From the magic
      squares can be obtained certain numbers which are said to be the numbers
      of the planets; their orderliness, we are told, reflects the order of the
      heavens, and from a consideration of them the magical properties of the
      planets which they represent can be arrived at. For example, in the above
      table the number of rows of numbers is 5. The total number of numbers in
      the table is the square of this number, namely, 25, which is also the
      greatest number in the table. The sum of any row or column is 65. And,
      finally, the sum of all the numbers is the product of the number of rows
      (namely, 5) and the sum of any row (namely, 65), <i>i.e</i>. 325. These
      numbers, namely, 5, 25, 65, and 325, are the numbers of Mars. Sets of
      numbers for the other planets are obtained in exactly the same manner.(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) Readers acquainted with mathematics will notice that if <i>n</i> is
      the number of rows in such a "magic square," the other numbers derived as
      above will be n[2S], 1/2<i>n</i>(<i>n</i>[2S] + 1), and 1/2<i>n</i>[2S](<i>n</i>[2S]
      + 1). This can readily be proved by the laws of arithmetical progressions.
      Rather similar but more complicated and less uniform "magic squares" are
      attributed to PARACELSUS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to each planet is assigned an Intelligence or good spirit, and an Evil
      Spirit or demon; and the names of these spirits are related to certain of
      the numbers of the planets. The other numbers are also connected with holy
      and magical Hebrew names. AGRIPPA, and BARRETT copying him, gives the
      following table of "names answering to the numbers of Mars":&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5. He, the letter of the holy name.          [hb ]
     25.                                [hb ___]
     65. Adonai.                             [hb ____]
     325. Graphiel, the Intelligence of Mars.     [hb _______]
     325. Barzabel, the Spirit of Mars.      [hb _______]
</pre>
    <p>
      Similar tables are given for the other planets. The numbers can be derived
      from the names by regarding the Hebrew letters of which they are composed
      as numbers, in which case [hb ] (Aleph) to [hb ] (Teth) represent the
      units 1 to 9 in order, [hb ] (Jod) to [hb ] (Tzade) the tens 10 to 90 in
      order, [hb ] (Koph) to [hb ] (Tau) the hundreds 100 to 400, whilst the
      hundreds 500 to 900 are represented by special terminal forms of certain
      of the Hebrew letters.(2) It is evident that no little wasted ingenuity
      must have been employed in working all this out.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) It may be noticed that this makes [hb _______] equal to 326, one unit
      too much. Possibly an Alelph should be omitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each planet has its own seal or signature, as well as the signature of its
      intelligence and the signature of its demon. These signatures were
      supposed to represent the characters of the planets' intelligences and
      demons respectively. The signature of Mars is shown in fig. 26, that of
      its intelligence in fig. 27, and that of its demon in fig. 28.
    </p>
    <p>
      These various details were inscribed on the talismans each of which was
      supposed to confer its own peculiar benefits&mdash;as follows: On one side
      must be engraved the proper magic table and the astrological sign of the
      planet, together with the highest planetary number, the sacred names
      corresponding to the planet, and the name of the intelligence of the
      planet, but not the name of its demon. On the other side must be engraved
      the seals of the planet and of its intelligence, and also the astrological
      sign. BARRETT says, regarding the demons:(1) "It is to be understood that
      the intelligences are the presiding good angels that are set over the
      planets; but that the spirits or daemons, with their names, seals, or
      characters, are never inscribed upon any Talisman, except to execute any
      evil effect, and that they are subject to the intelligences, or good
      spirits; and again, when the spirits and their characters are used, it
      will be more conducive to the effect to add some divine name appropriate
      to that effect which we desire." Evil talismans can also be prepared, we
      are informed, by using a metal antagonistic to the signs engraved thereon.
      The complete talisman of Mars is shown in fig. 29.

      ALPHONSE LOUIS CONSTANT,(1) a famous French occultist of the nineteenth
      century, who wrote under the name of "ELIPHAS LEVI," describes yet another
      system of talismans. He says: "The Pentagram must be always engraved on
      one side of the talisman, with a circle for the Sun, a crescent for the
      Moon, a winged caduceus for Mercury, a sword for Mars, a G for Venus, a
      crown for Jupiter, and a scythe for Saturn. The other side of the talisman
      should bear the sign of Solomon, that is, the six-pointed star formed by
      two interlaced triangles; in the centre there should be placed a human
      figure for the sun talismans, a cup for those of the Moon, a dog's head
      for those of Jupiter, a lion for those of Mars, a dove's for those of
      Venus, a bull's or goat's for those of Saturn. The names of the seven
      angels should be added either in Hebrew, Arabic, or magic characters
      similar to those of the alphabets of Trimethius. The two triangles of
      Solomon may be replaced by the double cross of Ezekiel's wheels, this
      being found on a great number of ancient pentacles. All objects of this
      nature, whether in metals or in precious stones, should be carefully
      wrapped in silk satchels of a colour analogous to the spirit of the
      planet, perfumed with the perfumes of the corresponding day, and preserved
      from all impure looks and touches."(2)

      ELIPHAS LEVI, following PYTHAGORAS and many of the mediaeval magicians,
      regarded the pentagram, or five-pointed star, as an extremely powerful
      pentacle. According to him, if with one horn in the ascendant it is the
      sign of the microcosm&mdash;Man. With two horns in the ascendant, however,
      it is the sign of the Devil, "the accursed Goat of Mendes," and an
      instrument of black magic. We can, indeed, trace some faint likeness
      between the pentagram and the outline form of a man, or of a goat's head,
      according to whether it has one or two horns in the ascendant
      respectively, which resemblances may account for this idea. Fig. 30 shows
      the pentagram embellished with other symbols according to ELIPHAS LEVI,
      whilst fig. 31 shows his embellished form of the six-pointed star, or Seal
      of SOLOMON. This, he says, is "the sign of the Macrocosmos, but is less
      powerful than the Pentagram, the microcosmic sign," thus contradicting
      PYTHAGORAS, who, as we have seen, regarded the pentagram as the sign of
      the Macrocosm. ELIPHAS LEVI asserts that he attempted the evocation of the
      spirit of APOLLONIUS of Tyana in London on 24th July 1854, by the aid of a
      pentagram and other magical apparatus and ritual, apparently with success,
      if we may believe his word. But he sensibly suggests that probably the
      apparition which appeared was due to the effect of the ceremonies on his
      own imagination, and comes to the conclusion that such magical experiments
      are injurious to health.(1)

      Magical rings were prepared on the same principle as were talismans. Says
      CORNELIUS AGRIPPA: "The manner of making these kinds of Magical Rings is
      this, viz.: When any Star ascends fortunately, with the fortunate aspect
      or conjunction of the Moon, we must take a stone and herb that is under
      that Star, and make a ring of the metal that is suitable to this Star, and
      in it fasten the stone, putting the herb or root under it&mdash;not
      omitting the inscriptions of images, names, and characters, as also the
      proper suffumigations...."(1) SOLOMON'S ring was supposed to have been
      possessed of remarkable occult virtue. Says JOSEPHUS (<i>c</i>. A.D.
      37-100): "God also enabled him (SOLOMON) to learn that skill which expels
      demons, which is a science useful and sanative to men. He composed such
      incantations also by which distempers are alleviated. And he left behind
      him the manner of using exorcisms, by which they drive away demons, so
      that they never return; and this method of cure is of great force unto
      this day; for I have seen a certain man of my own country, whose name was
      Eleazar, releasing people that were demoniacal in the presence of
      Vespasian, and his sons, and his captains, and the whole multitude of his
      soldiers. The manner of the cure was this; he put a ring that had under
      the seal a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon, to the
      nostrils of the demoniac, after which he drew out the demon through his
      nostrils: and when the man fell down immediately, he abjured him to return
      unto him no more, making still mention of Solomon, and reciting the
      incantations which he composed."(2)

      Enough has been said already to indicate the general nature of talismanic
      magic. No one could maintain otherwise than that much of it is pure
      nonsense; but the subject should not, therefore, be dismissed as
      valueless, or lacking significance. It is past belief that amulets and
      talismans should have been believed in for so long unless they APPEARED to
      be productive of some of the desired results, though these may have been
      due to forces quite other than those which were supposed to be operative.
      Indeed, it may be said that there has been no widely held superstition
      which does not embody some truth, like some small specks of gold hidden in
      an uninviting mass of quartz. As the poet BLAKE put it: "Everything
      possible to be believ'd is an image of truth";(1) and the attempt may here
      be made to extract the gold of truth from the quartz of superstition
      concerning talismanic magic. For this purpose the various theories
      regarding the supposed efficacy of talismans must be examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) "Proverbs of Hell" (<i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of these theories have already been noted, but the doctrine of
      effluvia admittedly applied only to a certain class of amulets, and, I
      think, need not be seriously considered. The "astral-spirit theory" (as it
      may be called), in its ancient form at any rate, is equally untenable
      to-day. The discoveries of new planets and new metals seem destructive of
      the belief that there can be any occult connection between planets,
      metals, and the days of the week, although the curious fact discovered by
      Mr OLD, to which I have referred (footnote, p. 63@@@), assuredly demands
      an explanation, and a certain validity may, perhaps, be allowed to
      astrological symbolism. As concerns the belief in the existence of what
      may be called (although the term is not a very happy one) "discarnate
      spirits," however, the matter, in view of the modern investigation of
      spiritistic and other abnormal psychical phenomena, stands in a different
      position. There can, indeed, be little doubt that very many of the
      phenomena observed at spiritistic seances come under the category of
      deliberate fraud, and an even larger number, perhaps, can be explained on
      the theory of the subconscious self. I think, however, that the evidence
      goes to show that there is a residuum of phenomena which can only be
      explained by the operation, in some way, of discarnate intelligences.(1)
      Psychical research may be said to have supplied the modern world with the
      evidence of the existence of discarnate personalities, and of their
      operation on the material plane, which the ancient world lacked. But so
      far as our present subject is concerned, all the evidence obtainable goes
      to show that the phenomena in question only take place in the presence of
      what is called "a medium"&mdash;a person of peculiar nervous or psychical
      organisation. That this is the case, moreover, appears to be the general
      belief of spiritists on the subject. In the sense, then, in which "a
      talisman" connotes a material object of such a nature that by its aid the
      powers of discarnate intelligences may become operative on material
      things, we might apply the term "talisman" to the nervous system of a
      medium: but then that would be the only talisman. Consequently, even if
      one is prepared to admit the whole of modern spiritistic theory, nothing
      is thereby gained towards a belief in talismans, and no light is shed upon
      the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) The publications of The Society for Psychical Research, and FREDERICK
      MYERS' monumental work on <i>Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily
      Death</i>, should be specially consulted. I have attempted a brief
      discussion of modern spiritualism and psychical research in my <i>Matter,
      Spirit, and the Cosmos</i> (1910), chap. ii.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another theory concerning talismans which commended itself to many of the
      old occult philosophers, PARACELSUS for instance, is what may be called
      the "occult force" theory. This theory assumes the existence of an occult
      mental force, a force capable of being exerted by the human will, apart
      from its usual mode of operation by means of the body. It was believed to
      be possible to concentrate this mental energy and infuse it into some
      suitable medium, with the production of a talisman, which was thus
      regarded as a sort of accumulator for mental energy. The theory seems a
      fantastic one to modern thought, though, in view of the many startling
      phenomena brought to light by psychical research, it is not advisable to
      be too positive regarding the limitations of the powers of the human mind.
      However, I think we shall find the element of truth in the otherwise
      absurd belief in talismans by means of what may be called, not altogether
      fancifully perhaps, a transcendental interpretation of this "occult force"
      theory. I suggest, that is, that when a believer makes a talisman, the
      transference of the occult energy is ideal, not actual; that the power,
      believed to reside in the talisman itself, is the power due to the reflex
      action of the believer's mind. The power of what transcendentalists call
      "the imagination" cannot be denied; for example, no one can deny that a
      man with a firm conviction that such a success will be achieved by him, or
      such a danger avoided, will be far more likely to gain his desire, other
      conditions being equal, than one of a pessimistic turn of mind. The mere
      conviction itself is a factor in success, or a factor in failure,
      according to its nature; and it seems likely that herein will be found a
      true explanation of the effects believed to be due to the power of the
      talisman.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, however, we must beware of the exaggerations into which
      certain schools of thought have fallen in their estimates of the powers of
      the imagination. These exaggerations are particularly marked in the views
      which are held by many nowadays with regard to "faith-healing," although
      the "Christian Scientists" get out of the difficulty&mdash;at least to
      their own satisfaction&mdash;by ascribing their alleged cures to the Power
      of the Divine Mind, and not to the power of the individual mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the real question involved in this "transcendental theory of
      talismans" as I may, perhaps, call it, is that of the operation of
      incarnate spirit on the plane of matter. This operation takes place only
      through the medium of the nervous system, and it has been suggested,(1) to
      avoid any violation of the law of the conservation of energy, that it is
      effected, not by the transference, as is sometimes supposed, of energy
      from the spiritual to the material plane, but merely by means of directive
      control over the expenditure of energy derived by the body from purely
      physical sources, <i>e.g</i>. the latent chemical energy bound up in the
      food eaten and the oxygen breathed.

      I am not sure that this theory really avoids the difficulty which it is
      intended to obviate;(1) but it is at least an interesting one, and at any
      rate there may be modes in which the body, under the directive control of
      the spirit, may expend energy derived from the material plane, of which we
      know little or nothing. We have the testimony of many eminent
      authorities(2) to the phenomenon of the movement of physical objects
      without contact at spiritistic seances. It seems to me that the
      introduction of discarnate intelligences to explain this phenomenon is
      somewhat gratuitous&mdash;the psychic phenomena which yield evidence of
      the survival of human personality after bodily death are of a different
      character. For if we suppose this particular phenomenon to be due to
      discarnate spirits, we must, in view of what has been said concerning
      "mediums," conclude that the movements in question are not produced by
      these spirits DIRECTLY, but through and by means of the nervous system of
      the medium present. Evidently, therefore, the means for the production of
      the phenomenon reside in the human nervous system (or, at any rate, in the
      peculiar nervous system of "mediums"), and all that is lacking is
      intelligence or initiative to use these means. This intelligence or
      initiative can surely be as well supplied by the sub-consciousness as by a
      discarnate intelligence. Consequently, it does not seem unreasonable to
      suppose that equally remarkable phenomena may have been produced by the
      aid of talismans in the days when these were believed in, and may be
      produced to-day, if one has sufficient faith&mdash;that is to say,
      produced by man when in the peculiar condition of mind brought about by
      the intense belief in the power of a talisman. And here it should be noted
      that the term "talisman" may be applied to any object (or doctrine) that
      is believed to possess peculiar power or efficacy. In this fact, I think,
      is to be found the peculiar danger of erroneous doctrines which promise
      extraordinary benefits, here and now on the material plane, to such as
      believe in them. Remarkable results may follow an intense belief in such
      doctrines, which, whilst having no connection whatever with their
      accuracy, being proportional only to the intensity with which they are
      held, cannot do otherwise than confirm the believer in the validity of his
      beliefs, though these may be in every way highly fantastic and erroneous.
      Both the Roman Catholic, therefore, and the Buddhist may admit many of the
      marvels attributed to the relics of each other's saints; though, in
      denying that these marvels prove the accuracy of each other's religious
      doctrines, each should remember that the same is true of his own.

      In illustration of the real power of the imagination, I may instance the
      Maori superstition of the Taboo. According to the Maories, anyone who
      touches a tabooed object will assuredly die, the tabooed object being a
      sort of "anti-talisman". Professor FRAZER(1) says: "Cases have been known
      of Maories dying of sheer fright on learning that they had unwittingly
      eaten the remains of a chief's dinner or handled something that belonged
      to him," since such objects were, <i>ipso facto</i>, tabooed. He gives the
      following case on good authority: "A woman, having partaken of some fine
      peaches from a basket, was told that they had come from a tabooed place.
      Immediately the basket dropped from her hands and she cried out in agony
      that the atua or godhead of the chief, whose divinity had been thus
      profaned, would kill her. That happened in the afternoon, and next day by
      twelve o'clock she was dead." For us the power of the taboo does not
      exist; for the Maori, who implicitly believes in it, it is a very potent
      reality, but this power of the taboo resides not in external objects but
      in his own mind.

      Dr HADDON(2) quotes a similar but still more remarkable story of a young
      Congo negro which very strikingly shows the power of the imagination. The
      young negro, "being on a journey, lodged at a friend's house; the latter
      got a wild hen for his breakfast, and the young man asked if it were a
      wild hen. His host answered 'No.' Then he fell on heartily, and afterwards
      proceeded on his journey. After four years these two met together again,
      and his old friend asked him 'if he would eat a wild hen,' to which he
      answered that it was tabooed to him. Hereat the host began immediately to
      laugh, inquiring of him, 'What made him refuse it now, when he had eaten
      one at his table about four years ago?' At the hearing of this the negro
      immediately fell a-trembling, and suffered himself to be so far possessed
      with the effects of imagination that he died in less than twenty-four
      hours after."

      There are, of course, many stories about amulets, <i>etc</i>., which
      cannot be thus explained. For example, ELIHU RICH gives the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "In 1568, we are told (Transl. of Salverte, p. 196) that the Prince of
      Orange condemned a Spanish prisoner to be shot at Juliers. The soldiers
      tied him to a tree and fired, but he was invulnerable. They then stripped
      him to see what armour he wore, but they found only an amulet bearing the
      figure of a lamb (the <i>Agnus Dei</i>, we presume). This was taken from
      him, and he was then killed by the first shot. De Baros relates that the
      Portuguese in like manner vainly attempted to destroy a Malay, so long as
      he wore a bracelet containing a bone set in gold, which rendered him proof
      against their swords. A similar marvel is related in the travels of the
      veracious Marco Polo. 'In an attempt of Kublai Khan to make a conquest of
      the island of Zipangu, a jealousy arose between the two commanders of the
      expedition, which led to an order for putting the whole garrison to the
      sword. In obedience to this order, the heads of all were cut off excepting
      of eight persons, who by the efficacy of a diabolical charm, consisting of
      a jewel or amulet introduced into the right arm, between the skin and the
      flesh, were rendered secure from the effects of iron, either to kill or
      wound. Upon this discovery being made, they were beaten with a heavy
      wooden club, and presently died.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) I think, however, that these, and many similar stories, must be taken
      <i>cum grano salis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, mention must be made of a very interesting and suggestive
      philosophical doctrine&mdash;the Law of Correspondences,&mdash;due in its
      explicit form to the Swedish philosopher, who was both scientist and
      mystic, EMANUEL SWEDENBORG. To deal in any way adequately with this
      important topic is totally impossible within the confines of the present
      discussion.(2) But, to put the matter as briefly as possible, it may be
      said that SWEDENBORG maintains (and the conclusion, I think, is valid)
      that all causation is from the spiritual world, physical causation being
      but secondary, or apparent&mdash;that is to say, a mere reflection, as it
      were, of the true process. He argues from this, thereby supplying a
      philosophical basis for the unanimous belief of the nature-mystics, that
      every natural object is the symbol (because the creation) of an idea or
      spiritual verity in its widest sense. Thus, there are symbols which are
      inherent in the nature of things, and symbols which are not. The former
      are genuine, the latter merely artificial. Writing from the transcendental
      point of view, ELIPHAS LEVI says: "Ceremonies, vestments, perfumes,
      characters and figures being...necessary to enlist the imagination in the
      education of the will, the success of magical works depends upon the
      faithful observance of all the rites, which are in no sense fantastic or
      arbitrary, having been transmitted to us by antiquity, and permanently
      subsisting by the essential laws of analogical realisation and of the
      correspondence which inevitably connects ideas and forms."(1b) Some
      scepticism, perhaps, may be permitted as to the validity of the latter
      part of this statement, and the former may be qualified by the proviso
      that such things are only of value in the right education of the will, if
      they are, indeed, genuine, and not merely artificial, symbols. But the
      writer, as I think will be admitted, has grasped the essential point, and,
      to conclude our excursion, as we began it, with a definition, I will say
      that <i>the power of the talisman is the power of the mind (or
      imagination) brought into activity by means of a suitable symbol</i>.

      VII. CEREMONIAL MAGIC IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE word "magic," if one may be permitted to say so, is itself almost
      magical&mdash;magical in its power to conjure up visions in the human
      mind. For some these are of bloody rites, pacts with the powers of
      darkness, and the lascivious orgies of the Saturnalia or Witches' Sabbath;
      in other minds it has pleasanter associations, serving to transport them
      from the world of fact to the fairyland of fancy, where the purse of
      FORTUNATUS, the lamp and ring of ALADDIN, fairies, gnomes, jinn, and
      innumerable other strange beings flit across the scene in a marvellous
      kaleidoscope of ever-changing wonders. To the study of the magical beliefs
      of the past cannot be denied the interest and fascination which the
      marvellous and wonderful ever has for so many minds, many of whom,
      perhaps, cannot resist the temptation of thinking that there may be some
      element of truth in these wonderful stories. But the study has a greater
      claim to our attention; for, as I have intimated already, magic represents
      a phase in the development of human thought, and the magic of the past was
      the womb from which sprang the science of the present, unlike its parent
      though it be.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then is magic? According to the dictionary definition&mdash;and this
      will serve us for the present&mdash;it is the (pretended) art of producing
      marvellous results by the aid of spiritual beings or arcane spiritual
      forces. Magic, therefore, is the practical complement of animism. Wherever
      man has really believed in the existence of a spiritual world, there do we
      find attempts to enter into communication with that world's inhabitants
      and to utilise its forces.Professor LEUBA(1) and others distinguish
      between propitiative behaviour towards the beings of the spiritual world,
      as marking the religious attitude, and coercive behaviour towards these
      beings as characteristic of the magical attitude; but one form of
      behaviour merges by insensible degrees into the other, and the distinction
      (though a useful one) may, for our present purpose, be neglected.

      Animism, "the Conception of Spirit everywhere" as Mr EDWARD CLODD(2)
      neatly calls it, and perhaps man's earliest view of natural phenomena,
      persisted in a modified form, as I have pointed out in "Some
      Characteristics of Mediaeval Thought," throughout the Middle Ages. A
      belief in magic persisted likewise. In the writings of the Greek
      philosophers of the Neo-Platonic school, in that curious body of esoteric
      Jewish lore known as the Kabala, and in the works of later occult
      philosophers such as AGRIPPA and PARACELSUS, we find magic, or rather the
      theory upon which magic as an art was based, presented in its most
      philosophical form. If there is anything of value for modern thought in
      the theory of magic, here is it to be found; and it is, I think, indeed to
      be found, absurd and fantastic though the practices based upon this
      philosophy, or which this philosophy was thought to substantiate, most
      certainly are. I shall here endeavour to give a sketch of certain of the
      outstanding doctrines of magical philosophy, some details concerning the
      art of magic, more especially as practiced in the Middle Ages in Europe,
      and, finally, an attempt to extract from the former what I consider to be
      of real worth. We have already wandered down many of the byways of magical
      belief, and, indeed, the word "magic" may be made to cover almost every
      superstition of the past: To what we have already gained on previous
      excursions the present, I hope, will add what we need in order to take a
      synthetic view of the whole subject.

    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, something must be said concerning what is called the
      Doctrine of Emanations, a theory of prime importance in Neo-Platonic and
      Kabalistic ontology. According to this theory, everything in the universe
      owes its existence and virtue to an emanation from God, which divine
      emanation is supposed to descend, step by step (so to speak), through the
      hierarchies of angels and the stars, down to the things of earth, that
      which is nearer to the Source containing more of the divine nature than
      that which is relatively distant. As CORNELIUS AGRIPPA expresses it: "For
      God, in the first place is the end and beginning of all Virtues; he gives
      the seal of #the <i>Ideas</i> to his servants, the Intelligences; who as
      faithful officers, sign all things intrusted to them with an Ideal Virtue;
      the Heavens and Stars, as instruments, disposing the matter in the mean
      while for the receiving of those forms which reside in Divine Majesty (as
      saith Plato in Timeus) and to be conveyed by Stars; and the Giver of Forms
      distributes them by the ministry of his Intelligences, which he hath set
      as Rulers and Controllers over his Works, to whom such a power is
      intrusted to things committed to them that so all Virtues of Stones,
      Herbs, Metals, and all other things may come from the Intelligences, the
      Governors. The Form, therefore, and Virtue of things comes first from the
      <i>Ideas</i>, then from the ruling and governing Intelligences, then from
      the aspects of the Heavens disposing, and lastly from the tempers of the
      Elements disposed, answering the influences of the Heavens, by which the
      Elements themselves are ordered, or disposed. These kinds of operations,
      therefore, are performed in these inferior things by express forms, and in
      the Heavens by disposing virtues, in Intelligences by mediating rules, in
      the Original Cause by <i>Ideas</i> and exemplary forms, all which must of
      necessity agree in the execution of the effect and virtue of every thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is, therefore, a wonderful virtue and operation in every Herb and
      Stone, but greater in a Star, beyond which, even from the governing
      Intelligences everything receiveth and obtains many things for itself,
      especially from the Supreme Cause, with whom all things do mutually and
      exactly correspond, agreeing in an harmonious consent, as it were in hymns
      always praising the highest Maker of all things.... There is, therefore,
      no other cause of the necessity of effects than the connection of all
      things with the First Cause, and their correspondency with those Divine
      patterns and eternal <i>Ideas</i> whence every thing hath its determinate
      and particular place in the exemplary world, from whence it lives and
      receives its original being: And every virtue of herbs, stones, metals,
      animals, words and speeches, and all things that are of God, is placed
      there."(1) As compared with the <i>ex nihilo</i> creationism of orthodox
      theology, this theory is as light is to darkness. Of course, there is much
      in CORNELIUS AGRIPPA'S statement of it which is inacceptable to modern
      thought; but these are matters of form merely, and do not affect the
      doctrine fundamentally. For instance, as a nexus between spirit and matter
      AGRIPPA places the stars: modern thought prefers the ether. The theory of
      emanations may be, and was, as a matter of fact, made the justification of
      superstitious practices of the grossest absurdity, but on the other hand
      it may be made the basis of a lofty system of transcendental philosophy,
      as, for instance, that of EMANUEL SWEDENBORG, whose ontology resembles in
      some respects that of the Neo-Platonists. AGRIPPA uses the theory to
      explain all the marvels which his age accredited, marvels which we know
      had for the most part no existence outside of man's imagination. I
      suggest, on the contrary, that the theory is really needed to explain the
      commonplace, since, in the last analysis, every bit of experience, every
      phenomenon, be it ever so ordinary&mdash;indeed the very fact of
      experience itself,&mdash;is most truly marvellous and magical, explicable
      only in terms of spirit. As ELIPHAS LEVI well says in one of his flashes
      of insight: "The supernatural is only the natural in an extraordinary
      grade, or it is the exalted natural; a miracle is a phenomenon which
      strikes the multitude because it is unexpected; the astonishing is that
      which astonishes; miracles are effects which surprise those who are
      ignorant of their causes, or assign them causes w hich are not in
      proportion to such effects."(1b) But I am anticipating the sequel.

    <p>
      The doctrine of emanations makes the universe one vast harmonious whole,
      between whose various parts there is an exact analogy, correspondence, or
      sympathetic relation. "Nature" (the productive principle), says IAMBLICHOS
      (3rd-4th century), the Neo-Platonist, "in her peculiar way, makes a
      likeness of invisible principles through symbols in visible forms."(2) The
      belief that seemingly similar things sympathetically affect one another,
      and that a similar relation holds good between different things which have
      been intimately connected with one another as parts within a whole, is a
      very ancient one. Most primitive peoples are very careful to destroy all
      their nail-cuttings and hair-clippings, since they believe that a witch
      gaining possession of these might work them harm. For a similar reason
      they refuse to reveal their REAL names, which they regard as part of
      themselves, and adopt nicknames for common use. The belief that a witch
      can torment an enemy by making an image of his person in clay or wax,
      correctly naming it, and mutilating it with pins, or, in the case of a
      waxen image, melting it by fire, is a very ancient one, and was held
      throughout and beyond the Middle Ages. The Sympathetic Powder of Sir
      KENELM DIGBY we have already noticed, as well as other instances of the
      belief in "sympathy," and examples of similar superstitions might be
      multiplied almost indefinitely. Such are generally grouped under the term
      "sympathetic magic"; but inasmuch as all magical practices assume that by
      acting on part of a thing, or a symbolic representation of it, one acts
      magically on the whole, or on the thing symbolised, the expression may in
      its broadest sense be said to involve the whole of magic.

      The names of the Divine Being, angels and devils, the planets of the solar
      system (including sun and moon) and the days of the week, birds and
      beasts, colours, herbs, and precious stones&mdash;all, according to
      old-time occult philosophy, are connected by the sympathetic relation
      believed to run through all creation, the knowledge of which was essential
      to the magician; as well, also, the chief portions of the human body, for
      man, as we have seen, was believed to be a microcosm&mdash;a universe in
      miniature. I have dealt with this matter and exhibited some of the
      supposed correspondences in "The Belief in Talismans". Some further
      particulars are shown in the annexed table, for which I am mainly indebted
      to AGRIPPA. But, as in the case of the zodiacal gems already dealt with,
      the old authorities by no means agree as to the majority of the planetary
      correspondences.

      The names of the angels are from Mr Mather's translation of <i>Clavicula
      Salomonis</i>; the other correspondences are from the second book of
      Agrippa's <i>Occult Philosophy</i>, chap. x.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many cases these supposed correspondences are based, as will be obvious
      to the reader, upon purely trivial resemblances, and, in any case,
      whatever may be said&mdash;and I think a great deal may be said&mdash;in
      favour of the theory of symbology, there is little that may be adduced to
      support the old occultists' application of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So essential a part does the use of symbols play in all magical operations
      that we may, I think, modify the definition of "magic" adopted at the
      outset, and define "magic" as "an attempt to employ the powers of the
      spiritual world for the production of marvellous results, BY THE AID OF
      SYMBOLS." It has, on the other hand, been questioned whether the appeal to
      the spirit-world is an essential element in magic. But a close examination
      of magical practices always reveals at the root a belief in spiritual
      powers as the operating causes. The belief in talismans at first sight
      seems to have little to do with that in a supernatural realm; but, as we
      have seen, the talisman was always a silent invocation of the powers of
      some spiritual being with which it was symbolically connected, and whose
      sign was engraved thereon. And, as Dr T. WITTON DAVIES well remarks with
      regard to "sympathetic magic": "Even this could not, at the start, be
      anything other than a symbolic prayer to the spirit or spirits having
      authority in these matters. In so far as no spirit is thought of, it is a
      mere survival, and not magic at all...."(1)

      What I regard as the two essentials of magical practices, namely, the use
      of symbols and the appeal to the supernatural realm, are most obvious in
      what is called "ceremonial magic". Mediaeval ceremonial magic was
      subdivided into three chief branches&mdash;White Magic, Black Magic, and
      Necromancy. White magic was concerned with the evocations of angels,
      spiritual beings supposed to be essentially superior to mankind,
      concerning which I shall give some further details later&mdash;and the
      spirits of the elements,&mdash;which were, as I have mentioned in "Some
      Characteristics of Mediaeval Thought," personifications of the primeval
      forces of Nature. As there were supposed to be four elements, fire, air,
      water, and earth, so there were supposed to be four classes of elementals
      or spirits of the elements, namely, Salamanders, Sylphs, Undines, and
      Gnomes, inhabiting these elements respectively, and deriving their
      characters therefrom. Concerning these curious beings, the inquisitive
      reader may gain some information from a quaint little book, by the Abbe de
      MONTFAUCON DE VILLARS, entitled <i>The Count of Gabalis, or Conferences
      about Secret Sciences</i> (1670), translated into English and published in
      1680, which has recently been reprinted. The elementals, we learn
      therefrom, were, unlike other supernatural beings, thought to be mortal.
      They could, however, be rendered immortal by means of sexual intercourse
      with men or women, as the case might be; and it was, we are told, to the
      noble end of endowing them with this great gift, that the sages devoted
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goety, or black magic, was concerned with the evocation of demons and
      devils&mdash;spirits supposed to be superior to man in certain powers, but
      utterly depraved. Sorcery may be distinguished from witchcraft, inasmuch
      as the sorcerer attempted to command evil spirits by the aid of charms, <i>etc</i>.,
      whereas the witch or wizard was supposed to have made a pact with the Evil
      One; though both terms have been rather loosely used, "sorcery" being
      sometimes employed as a synonym for "necromancy". Necromancy was concerned
      with the evocation of the spirits of the dead: etymologically, the term
      stands for the art of foretelling events by means of such evocations,
      though it is frequently employed in the wider sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be unnecessary and tedious to give any detailed account of the
      methods employed in these magical arts beyond some general remarks. Mr A.
      E. WAITE gives full particulars of the various rituals in his <i>Book of
      Ceremonial Magic</i> (1911), to which the curious reader may be referred.
      The following will, in brief terms, convey a general idea of a magical
      evocation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Choosing a time when there is a favourable conjunction of the planets, the
      magician, armed with the implements of magical art, after much prayer and
      fasting, betakes himself to a suitable spot, alone, or perhaps accompanied
      by two trusty companions. All the articles he intends to employ, the
      vestments, the magic sword and lamp, the talismans, the book of spirits,
      <i>etc</i>., have been specially prepared and consecrated. If he is about
      to invoke a martial spirit, the magician's vestment will be of a red
      colour, the talismans in virtue of which he may have power over the spirit
      will be of iron, the day chosen a Tuesday, and the incense and perfumes
      employed of a nature analogous to Mars. In a similar manner all the
      articles employed and the rites performed must in some way be symbolical
      of the spirit with which converse is desired. Having arrived at the spot,
      the magician first of all traces the magic circle within which, we are
      told, no evil spirit can enter; he then commences the magic rite,
      involving various prayers and conjurations, a medley of meaningless words,
      and, in the case of the black art, a sacrifice. The spirit summoned then
      appears (at least, so we are told), and, after granting the magician's
      request, is licensed to depart&mdash;a matter, we are admonished, of great
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question naturally arises, What were the results obtained by these
      magical arts? How far, if at all, was the magician rewarded by the
      attainment of his desires? We have asked a similar question regarding the
      belief in talismans, and the reply which we there gained undoubtedly
      applies in the present case as well. Modern psychical research, as I have
      already pointed out, is supplying us with further evidence for the
      survival of human personality after bodily death than the innate
      conviction humanity in general seems to have in this belief, and the many
      reasons which idealistic philosophy advances in favour of it. The question
      of the reality of the phenomenon of "materialisation," that is, the bodily
      appearance of a discarnate spirit, such as is vouched for by spiritists,
      and which is what, it appears, was aimed at in necromancy (though why the
      discarnate should be better informed as to the future than the incarnate,
      I cannot suppose), must be regarded as <i>sub judice</i>.(1) Many cases of
      fraud in connection with the alleged production of this phenomenon have
      been detected in recent times; but, inasmuch as the last word has not yet
      been said on the subject, we must allow the possibility that necromancy in
      the past may have been sometimes successful. But as to the existence of
      the angels and devils of magical belief&mdash;as well, one might add, of
      those of orthodox faith,&mdash;nothing can be adduced in evidence of this
      either from the results of psychical research or on <i>a priori</i>
      grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) The late Sir WILLIAM CROOKES' <i>Experimental Researches in the
      Phenomena of Spiritualism</i> contains evidence in favour of the reality
      of this phenomenon very difficult to gainsay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pseudo-DIONYSIUS classified the angels into three hierarchies, each
      subdivided into three orders, as under:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>First Hierarchy</i>.&mdash;Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Second Hierarchy</i>.&mdash;Dominions, Powers, and Authorities (or
      Virtues);
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Third Hierarchy</i>.&mdash;Principalities, Archangels, and Angels,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      and this classification was adopted by AGRIPPA and others.
      Pseudo-DIONYSIUS explains the names of these orders as follows: "... the
      holy designation of the Seraphim denotes either that they are kindling or
      burning; and that of the Cherubim, a fulness of knowledge or stream of
      wisdom.... The appellation of the most exalted and pre-eminent Thrones
      denotes their manifest exaltation above every grovelling inferiority, and
      their super-mundane tendency towards higher things;... and their
      invariable and firmly-fixed settlement around the veritable Highest, with
      the whole force of their powers.... The explanatory name of the Holy
      Lordships (Dominions) denotes a certain unslavish elevation... superior to
      every kind of cringing slavery, indomitable to every subserviency, and
      elevated above every dissimularity, ever aspiring to the true Lordship and
      source of Lordship.... The appellation of the Holy Powers denotes a
      certain courageous and unflinching virility... vigorously conducted to the
      Divine imitation, not forsaking the Godlike movement through its own
      unmanliness, but unflinchingly looking to the super-essential and
      powerful-making power, and becoming a powerlike image of this, as far as
      is attainable....The appellation of the Holy Authorities... denotes the
      beautiful and unconfused good order, with regard to Divine receptions, and
      the discipline of the super-mundane and intellectual authority...
      conducted indomitably, with good order towards Divine things.... (And the
      appellation) of the Heavenly Principalities manifests their princely and
      leading function, after the Divine example...."(1) There is a certain
      grandeur in these views, and if we may be permitted to understand by the
      orders of the hierarchy, "discrete" degrees (to use SWEDENBORG'S term) of
      spiritual reality&mdash;stages in spiritual involution,&mdash;we may see
      in them a certain truth as well. As I said, all virtue, power, and
      knowledge which man has from God was believed to descend to him by way of
      these angelical hierarchies, step by step; and thus it was thought that
      those of the lowest hierarchy alone were sent from heaven to man. It was
      such beings that white magic pretended to evoke. But the practical
      occultists, when they did not make them altogether fatuous, attributed to
      these angels characters not distinguishable from those of the devils. The
      description of the angels in the <i>Heptemeron</i>, or <i>Magical Elements</i>,(2)
      falsely at may be taken as fairly characteristic. Of MICHAEL and the other
      spirits of Sunday he writes: "Their nature is to procure Gold, Gemmes,
      Carbuncles, Riches; to cause one to obtain favour and benevolence; to
      dissolve the enmities of men; to raise men to honors; to carry or take
      away infirmities." Of GABRIEL and the other spirits of Monday, he says:
      "Their nature is to give silver; to convey things from place to place; to
      make horses swift, and to disclose the secrets of persons both present and
      future." Of SAMAEL and the other spirits of Tuesday he says: "Their nature
      is to cause wars, mortality, death and combustions; and to give two
      thousand Souldiers at a time; to bring death, infirmities or health," and
      so on for RAPHAEL, SACHIEL, ANAEL, CASSIEL, and their colleagues.(1b)

      Concerning the evil planetary spirits, the spurious <i>Fourth Book of
      Occult Philosophy</i>, attributed to CORNELIUS AGRIPPA, informs us that
      the spirits of Saturn "appear for the most part with a tall, lean, and
      slender body, with an angry countenance, having four faces; one in the
      hinder part of the head, one on the former part of the head, and on each
      side nosed or beaked: there likewise appeareth a face on each knee, of a
      black shining colour: their motion is the moving of the wince, with a
      kinde of earthquake: their signe is white earth, whiter than any Snow."
      The writer adds that their "particular forms are,&mdash;

      Concerning the spirits of Jupiter, he says that they "appear with a body
      sanguine and cholerick, of a middle stature, with a horrible fearful
      motion; but with a milde countenance, a gentle speech, and of the colour
      of Iron. The motion of them is flashings of Lightning and Thunder; their
      signe is, there will appear men about the circle, who shall seem to be
      devoured of Lions," their particular forms being&mdash;

      As to the Martian spirits, we learn that "they appear in a tall body,
      cholerick, a filthy countenance, of colour brown, swarthy or red, having
      horns like Harts horns, and Griphins claws, bellowing like wilde Bulls.
      Their Motion is like fire burning; their signe Thunder and Lightning about

    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think I shall be accused of being unduly sceptical if I say that
      such beings as these could not have been evoked by any magical rites,
      because such beings do not and did not exist, save in the magician's own
      imagination. The proviso, however, is important, for, inasmuch as these
      fantastic beings did exist in the imagination of the credulous, therein
      they may, indeed, have been evoked. The whole of magic ritual was well
      devised to produce hallucination. A firm faith in the ritual employed, and
      a strong effort of will to bring about the desired result, were usually
      insisted upon as essential to the success of the operation.(2) A period of
      fasting prior to the experiment was also frequently prescribed as
      necessary, which, by weakening the body, must have been conducive to
      hallucination. Furthermore, abstention from the gratification of the
      sexual appetite was stipulated in certain cases, and this, no doubt, had a
      similar effect, especially as concerns magical evocations directed to the
      satisfaction of the sexual impulse. Add to these factors the details of
      the ritual itself, the nocturnal conditions under which it was carried
      out, and particularly the suffumigations employed, which, most frequently,
      were of a narcotic nature, and it is not difficult to believe that almost
      any type of hallucination may have occurred. Such, as we have seen, was
      ELIPHAS LEVI'S view of ceremonial magic; and whatever may be said as
      concerns his own experiment therein (for one would have thought that the
      essential element of faith was lacking in this case), it is undoubtedly
      the true view as concerns the ceremonial magic of the past. As this author
      well says: "Witchcraft, properly so-called, that is ceremonial operation
      with intent to bewitch, acts only on the operator, and serves to fix and
      confirm his will, by formulating it with persistence and labour, the two
      conditions which make volition efficacious."(1b)

      EMANUEL SWEDENBORG in one place writes: "Magic is nothing but the
      perversion of order; it is especially the abuse of correspondences."(2) A
      study of the ceremonial magic of the Middle Ages and the following century
      or two certainly justifies SWEDENBORG in writing of magic as something
      evil. The distinction, rigid enough in theory, between white and black,
      legitimate and illegitimate, magic, was, as I have indicated, extremely
      indefinite in practice. As Mr A. E. WAITE justly remarks: "Much that
      passed current in the west as White (<i>i.e</i>. permissible) Magic was
      only a disguised goeticism, and many of the resplendent angels invoked
      with divine rites reveal their cloven hoofs. It is not too much to say
      that a large majority of past psychological experiments were conducted to
      establish communication with demons, and that for unlawful purposes. The
      popular conceptions concerning the diabolical spheres, which have been all
      accredited by magic, may have been gross exaggerations of fact concerning
      rudimentary and perverse intelligences, but the wilful viciousness of the
      communicants is substantially untouched thereby."(1b)

    </p>
    <p>
      These "psychological experiments" were not, save, perhaps, in rare cases,
      carried out in the spirit of modern psychical research, with the high aim
      of the man of science. It was, indeed, far otherwise; selfish motives were
      at the root of most of them; and, apart from what may be termed "medicinal
      magic," it was for the satisfaction of greed, lust, revenge, that men and
      women had recourse to magical arts. The history of goeticism and
      witchcraft is one of the most horrible of all histories. The "Grimoires,"
      witnesses to the superstitious folly of the past, are full of disgusting,
      absurd, and even criminal rites for the satisfaction of unlawful desires
      and passions. The Church was certainly justified in attempting to put down
      the practice of magic, but the means adopted in this design and the
      results to which they led were even more abominable than witchcraft
      itself. The methods of detecting witches and the tortures to which
      suspected persons were subjected to force them to confess to imaginary
      crimes, employed in so-called civilised England and Scotland and also in
      America, to say nothing of countries in which the "Holy" Inquisition held
      undisputed sway, are almost too horrible to describe. For details the
      reader may be referred to Sir WALTER SCOTT'S <i>Letters on Demonology and
      Witchcraft</i> (1830), and (as concerns America) COTTON MATHER'S The <i>Wonders
      of the Invisible World</i> (1692). The credulous Church and the credulous
      people were terribly afraid of the power of witchcraft, and, as always,
      fear destroyed their mental balance and made them totally disregard the
      demands of justice. The result may be well illustrated by what almost
      inevitably happens when a country goes to war; for war, as the Hon.
      BERTRAND RUSSELL has well shown, is fear's offspring. Fear of the enemy
      causes the military party to persecute in an insensate manner, without the
      least regard to justice, all those of their fellow-men whom they consider
      are not heart and soul with them in their cause; similarly the Church
      relentlessly persecuted its supposed enemies, of whom it was so afraid. No
      doubt some of the poor wretches that were tortured and killed on the
      charge of witchcraft really believed themselves to have made a pact with
      the devil, and were thus morally depraved, though, generally speaking,
      they were no more responsible for their actions than any other madmen. But
      the majority of the persons persecuted as witches and wizards were
      innocent even of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it would, I think, be unwise to disregard the existence of
      another side to the question of the validity and ethical value of magic,
      and to use the word only to stand for something essentially evil.
      SWEDENBORG, we may note, in the course of a long passage from the work
      from which I have already quoted, says that by "magic" is signified "the
      science of spiritual things"(1) His position appears to be that there is a
      genuine magic, or science of spiritual things, and a false magic, that
      science perverted: a view of the matter which I propose here to adopt. The
      word "magic" itself is derived from the Greek "magos," the wise man of the
      East, and hence the strict etymological meaning of the term is "the wisdom
      or science of the magi"; and it is, I think, significant that we are told
      (and I see no reason to doubt the truth of it) that the magi were among
      the first to worship the new-born CHRIST.(2)

    </p>
    <p>
      If there be an abuse of correspondences, or symbols, there surely must
      also be a use, to which the word "magic" is not inapplicable. As such,
      religious ritual, and especially the sacraments of the Christian Church,
      will, no doubt, occur to the minds of those who regard these symbols as
      efficacious, though they would probably hesitate to apply the term
      "magical" to them. But in using this term as applying thereto, I do not
      wish to suggest that any such rites or ceremonies possess, or can possess,
      any CAUSAL efficacy in the moral evolution of the soul. The will alone, in
      virtue of the power vouchsafed to it by the Source of all power, can
      achieve this; but I do think that the soul may be assisted by ritual,
      harmoniously related to the states of mind which it is desired to induce.
      No doubt there is a danger of religious ritual, especially when its
      meaning is lost, being engaged in for its own sake. It is then mere
      superstition;(1) and, in view of the danger of this degeneracy, many
      robust minds, such as the members of the Society of Friends, prefer to
      dispense with its aid altogether. When ritual is associated with erroneous
      doctrines, the results are even more disastrous, as I have indicated in
      "The Belief in Talismans". But when ritual is allied with, and based upon,
      as adequately symbolising, the high teaching of genuine religion, it may
      be, and, in fact, is, found very helpful by many people. As such its
      efficacy seems to me to be altogether magical, in the best sense of that
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) As "ELIPHAS LEVI" well says: "Superstition... is the sign surviving
      the thought; it is the dead body of a religious rite." (<i>Op cit</i>., p.
      150.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But, indeed, I think a still wider application of the word "magic" is
      possible. "All experience is magic," says NOVALIS (1772-1801), "and only
      magically explicable";(2a) and again: "It is only because of the
      feebleness of our perceptions and activity that we do not perceive
      ourselves to be in a fairy world." No doubt it will be objected that the
      common experiences of daily life are "natural," whereas magic postulates
      the "supernatural". If, as is frequently done, we use the term "natural,"
      as relating exclusively to the physical realm, then, indeed, we may well
      speak of magic as "supernatural," because its aims are psychical. On the
      other hand, the term "natural" is sometimes employed as referring to the
      whole realm of order, and in this sense one can use the word "magic" as
      descriptive of Nature herself when viewed in the light of an idealistic
      philosophy, such as that of SWEDENBORG, in which all causation is seen to
      be essentially spiritual, the things of this world being envisaged as
      symbols of ideas or spiritual verities, and thus physical causation
      regarded as an appearance produced in virtue of the magical, non-causal
      efficacy of symbols.(1) Says CORNELIUS AGRIPPA: "... every day some
      natural thing is drawn by art and some divine thing is drawn by Nature
      which, the Egyptians, seeing, called Nature a Magicianess (<i>i.e</i>.)
      the very Magical power itself, in the attracting of like by like, and of
      suitable things by suitable."(2)

      I would suggest, in conclusion, that there is nothing really opposed to
      the spirit of modern science in the thesis that "all experience is magic,
      and only magically explicable." Science does not pretend to reveal the
      fundamental or underlying cause of phenomena, does not pretend to answer
      the final Why? This is rather the business of philosophy, though, in thus
      distinguishing between science and philosophy, I am far from insinuating
      that philosophy should be otherwise than scientific. We often hear
      religious but non-scientific men complain because scientific and perhaps
      equally as religious men do not in their books ascribe the production of
      natural phenomena to the Divine Power. But if they were so to do they
      would be transcending their business as scientists. In every science
      certain simple facts of experience are taken for granted: it is the
      business of the scientist to reduce other and more complex facts of
      experience to terms of these data, not to explain these data themselves.
      Thus the physicist attempts to reduce other related phenomena of greater
      complexity to terms of simple force and motion; but, What are force and
      motion? Why does force produce or result in motion? are questions which
      lie beyond the scope of physics. In order to answer these questions, if,
      indeed, this be possible, we must first inquire, How and why do these
      ideas of force and motion arise in our minds? These problems land us in
      the psychical or spiritual world, and the term "magic" at once becomes
      significant.

      VIII. ARCHITECTURAL SYMBOLISM
    </h2>
    <p>
      I WAS once rash enough to suggest in an essay "On Symbolism in Art"(1)
      that "a true work of art is at once realistic, imaginative, and
      symbolical," and that its aim is to make manifest the spiritual
      significance of the natural objects dealt with. I trust that those artists
      (no doubt many) who disagree with me will forgive me&mdash;a man of
      science&mdash;for having ventured to express any opinion whatever on the
      subject. But, at any rate, if the suggestions in question are accepted,
      then a criterion for distinguishing between art and craft is at once
      available; for we may say that, whilst craft aims at producing works which
      are physically useful, art aims at producing works which are spiritually
      useful. Architecture, from this point of view, is a combination of craft
      and art. It may, indeed, be said that the modern architecture which
      creates our dwelling-houses, factories, and even to a large extent our
      places of worship, is pure craft unmixed with art On the other hand, it
      might be argued that such works of architecture are not always devoid of
      decoration, and that "decorative art," even though the "decorative artist"
      is unconscious of this fact, is based upon rules and employs symbols which
      have a deep significance. The truly artistic element in architecture,
      however, is more clearly manifest if we turn our gaze to the past. One
      thinks at once, of course, of the pyramids and sphinx of Egypt, and the
      rich and varied symbolism of design and decoration of antique structures
      to be found in Persia and elsewhere in the East. It is highly probable
      that the Egyptian pyramids were employed for astronomical purposes, and
      thus subserved physical utility, but it seems no less likely that their
      shape was suggested by a belief in some system of geometrical symbolism,
      and was intended to embody certain of their philosophical or religious
      doctrines.

    </p>
    <p>
      The mediaeval cathedrals and churches of Europe admirably exhibit this
      combination of art with craft. Craft was needed to design and construct
      permanent buildings to protect worshippers from the inclemency of the
      weather; art was employed not only to decorate such buildings, but it
      dictated to craft many points in connection with their design. The
      builders of the mediaeval churches endeavoured so to construct their works
      that these might, as a whole and in their various parts, embody the
      truths, as they believed them, of the Christian religion: thus the
      cruciform shape of churches, their orientation, etc. The practical value
      of symbolism in church architecture is obvious. As Mr F. E. HULME remarks,
      "The sculptured fonts or stained-glass windows in the churches of the
      Middle Ages were full of teaching to a congregation of whom the greater
      part could not read, to whom therefore one great avenue of knowledge was
      closed. The ignorant are especially impressed by pictorial teaching, and
      grasp its meaning far more readily than they can follow a written
      description or a spoken discourse."(1)

    <p>
      The subject of symbolism in church architecture is an extensive one,
      involving many side issues. In these excursions we shall consider only one
      aspect of it, namely, the symbolic use of animal forms in English church
      architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr COLLINS, who has written, in recent years, an interesting work on
      this topic of much use to archaeologists as a book of data,(2a) points
      out, the great sources of animal symbolism were the famous <i>Physiologus</i>
      and other natural history books of the Middle Ages (generally called
      "Bestiaries"), and the Bible, mystically understood. The modern tendency
      is somewhat unsympathetic towards any attempt to interpret the Bible
      symbolically, and certainly some of the interpretations that have been
      forced upon it in the name of symbolism are crude and fantastic enough.
      But in the belief of the mystics, culminating in the elaborate system of
      correspondences of SWEDENBORG, that every natural object, every event in
      the history of the human race, and every word of the Bible, has a symbolic
      and spiritual significance, there is, I think, a fundamental truth. We
      must, however, as I have suggested already, distinguish between true and
      forced symbolism. The early Christians employed the fish as a symbol of
      Christ, because the Greek word for fish, icqus, is obtained by <i>notariqon</i>(1)
      from the phrase [gr 'Ihsous Cristos Qeou Uios, Swthr]&mdash;"JESUS CHRIST,
      the Son of God, the Saviour." Of course, the obvious use of such a symbol
      was its entire unintelligibility to those who had not yet been instructed
      in the mysteries of the Christian faith, since in the days of persecution
      some degree of secrecy was necessary. But the symbol has significance only
      in the Greek language, and that of an entirely arbitrary nature. There is
      nothing in the nature of the fish, apart from its name in Greek, which
      renders it suitable to be used as a symbol of CHRIST. Contrast this
      pseudo-symbol, however, with that of the Good Shepherd, the Lamb of God
      (fig. 34), or the Lion of Judah. Here we have what may be regarded as true
      symbols, something of whose meanings are clear to the smallest degree of
      spiritual sight, even though the second of them has frequently been badly
      misinterpreted.

      It was a belief in the spiritual or moral significance of nature similar
      to that of the mystical expositors of the Bible, that inspired the
      mediaeval naturalists. The Bestiaries almost invariably conclude the
      account of each animal with the moral that might be drawn from its
      behaviour. The interpretations are frequently very far-fetched, and as the
      writers were more interested in the morals than in the facts of natural
      history themselves, the supposed facts from which they drew their morals
      were frequently very far from being of the nature of facts. Sometimes the
      product of this inaccuracy is grotesque, as shown by the following
      quotation: "The elephants are in an absurd way typical of Adam and Eve,
      who ate of the forbidden fruit, and also have the dragon for their enemy.
      It was supposed that the elephant... used to sleep by leaning against a
      tree. The hunters would come by night, and cut the trunk through. Down he
      would come, roaring helplessly. None of his friends would be able to help
      him, until a small elephant should come and lever him up with his trunk.
      This small elephant was symbolic of Jesus Christ, Who came in great
      humility to rescue the human race which had fallen 'through a tree.' "(1)

      In some cases, though the symbolism is based upon quite erroneous notions
      concerning natural history, and is so far fantastic, it is not devoid of
      charm. The use of the pelican to symbolise the Saviour is a case in point.
      Legend tells us that when other food is unobtainable, the pelican thrusts
      its bill into its breast (whence the red colour of the bill) and feeds its
      young with its life-blood. Were this only a fact, the symbol would be most
      appropriate. There is another and far less charming form of the legend,
      though more in accord with current perversions of Christian doctrine,
      according to which the pelican uses its blood to revive its young, after
      having slain them through anger aroused by the great provocation which
      they are supposed to give it. For an example of the use of the pelican in
      church architecture see fig. 36.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mention must also be made of the purely fabulous animals of the
      Bestiaries, such as the basilisk, centaur, dragon, griffin, hydra,
      mantichora, unicorn, phoenix, <i>etc</i>. The centaur (fig. 39) was a
      beast, half man, half horse. It typified the flesh or carnal mind of man,
      and the legend of the perpetual war between the centaur and a certain
      tribe of simple savages who were said to live in trees in India,
      symbolised the combat between the flesh and the spirit.(1)

      With bow and arrow in its hands the centaur forms the astrological sign
      Sagittarius (or the Archer). An interesting example of this sign occurring
      in church architecture is to be found on the western doorway of
      Portchester Church&mdash;a most beautiful piece of Norman architecture.
      "This sign of the Zodiac," writes the Rev. Canon VAUGHAN, M.A., a former
      Vicar of Portchester, "was the badge of King Stephen, and its presence on
      the west front (of Portchester Church) seems to indicate, what was often
      the case elsewhere, that the elaborate Norman carving was not carried out
      until after the completion of the building."(2) The facts, however, that
      this Sagittarius is accompanied on the other side of the doorway by a
      couple of fishes, which form the astrological sign Pisces (or the Fishes),
      and that these two signs are what are termed, in astrological phraseology,
      the "houses" of the planet Jupiter, the "Major Fortune," suggest that the
      architect responsible for the design, influenced by the astrological
      notions of his day, may have put the signs there in order to attract
      Jupiter's beneficent influence. Or he may have had the Sagittarius carved
      for the reason Canon VAUGHAN suggests, and then, remembering how good a
      sign it was astrologically, had the Pisces added to complete the
      effect.(1b)

      14.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1b) Two other possible explanations of the Pisces have been suggested by
      the Rev. A. HEADLEY. In his MS. book written in 1888, when he was Vicar of
      Portchester, he writes: "I have discovered an interesting proof that it
      (the Church) was finished in Stephen's reign, namely, the figure of
      Sagittarius in the Western Doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stephen adopted this as his badge for the double reason that it formed
      part of the arms of the city of Blois, and that the sun was in Sagittarius
      in December when he came to the throne. I, therefore, conclude that this
      badge was placed where it is to mark the completion of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is another sign of the Zodiac in the archway, apparently Pisces.
      This may have been chosen to mark the month in which the church was
      finished, or simply on account of its nearness to the sea. At one time I
      fancied it might refer to March, the month in which Lady Day occurred,
      thus referring to the Patron Saint, St Mary. As the sun leaves Pisces just
      before Lady Day this does not explain it. Possibly in the old calendar it
      might do so. This is a matter for further research." (I have to thank the
      Rev. H. LAWRENCE FRY, present Vicar of Portchester, for this quotation,
      and the Rev. A. HEADLEY for permission to utilise it.)

      The phoenix and griffin we have encountered already in our excursions. The
      latter, we are told, inhabits desert places in India, where it can find
      nothing for its young to eat. It flies away to other regions to seek food,
      and is sufficiently strong to carry off an ox. Thus it symbolises the
      devil, who is ever anxious to carry away our souls to the deserts of hell.
      Fig. 37 illustrates an example of the use of this symbolic beast in church
      architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mantichora is described by PLINY (whose statements were
      unquestioningly accepted by the mediaeval naturalists), on the authority
      of CTESIAS (<i>fl</i>. 400 B.C.), as having "A triple row of teeth, which
      fit into each other like those of a comb, the face and ears of a man, and
      azure eyes, is the colour of blood, has the body of the lion, and a tail
      ending in a sting, like that of the scorpion. Its voice resembles the
      union of the sound of the flute and the trumpet; it is of excessive
      swiftness, and is particularly fond of human flesh."(1)

    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the unicorn, in an eighteenth-century work on natural history
      we read that this is "a Beast, which though doubted of by many Writers,
      yet is by others thus described: He has but one Horn, and that an
      exceedingly rich one, growing out of the middle of his Forehead. His Head
      resembles an Hart's, his Feet an Elephant's, his tail a Boar's, and the
      rest of his Body an Horse's. The Horn is about a Foot and half in length.
      His Voice is like the Lowing of an Ox. His Mane and Hair are of a
      yellowish Colour. His Horn is as hard as Iron, and as rough as any File,
      twisted or curled, like a flaming Sword; very straight, sharp, and every
      where black, excepting the Point. Great Virtues are attributed to it, in
      expelling of Poison and curing of several Diseases. He is not a Beast of
      prey."(2) The method of capturing the animal believed in by mediaeval
      writers was a curious one. The following is a literal translation from the
      <i>Bestiary</i> of PHILIPPE DE THAUN (12th century):&mdash;

      (1730), p. 6.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
 "Monosceros is an animal which has one horn on its head,
 Therefore it is so named; it has the form of a goat,
 It is caught by means of a virgin, now hear in what manner.
 When a man intends to hunt it and to take and ensnare it
 He goes to the forest where is its repair;
 There he places a virgin, with her breast uncovered,
 And by its smell the monosceros perceives it;
 Then it comes to the virgin, and kisses her breast,
 Falls asleep on her lap, and so comes to its death;
 The man arrives immediately, and kills it in its sleep,
 Or takes it alive and does as he likes with it.
 It signifies much, I will not omit to tell it you.

     "Monosceros is Greek, it means <i>one horn</i> in French:
 A beast of such a description signifies Jesus Christ;
 One God he is and shall be, and was and will continue so;
 He placed himself in the virgin, and took flesh for man's sake,
 And for virginity to show chastity;
 To a virgin he APPEARED and a virgin conceived him,
 A virgin she is, and will be, and will remain always.
 Now hear briefly the signification.

     "This animal in truth signifies God;
 Know that the virgin signifies St Mary;
 By her breast we understand similarly Holy Church;
 And then by the kiss it ought to signify,
 That a man when he sleeps is in semblance of death;
 God slept as man, who suffered death on the cross,
 And his destruction was our redemption,
 And his labour our repose,
 Thus God deceived the Devil by a proper semblance;
 Soul and body were one, so was God and man,
 And this is the signification of an animal of that description."(1)

    <p>
      This being the current belief concerning the symbolism of the unicorn in
      the Middle Ages, it is not surprising to find this animal utilised in
      church architecture; for an example see fig. 35.
    </p>
    <p>
      The belief in the existence of these fabulous beasts may very probably
      have been due to the materialising of what were originally nothing more
      than mere arbitrary symbols, as I have already suggested of the
      phoenix.(1) Thus the account of the mantichora may, as BOSTOCK has
      suggested, very well be a description of certain hieroglyphic figures,
      examples of which are still to be found in the ruins of Assyrian and
      Persian cities. This explanation seems, on the whole, more likely than the
      alternative hypothesis that such beliefs were due to mal-observation;
      though that, no doubt, helped in their formation.

    <p>
      It may be questioned, however, whether the architects and preachers of the
      Middle Ages altogether believed in the strange fables of the Bestiaries.
      As Mr COLLINS says in reply to this question: "Probably they were
      credulous enough. But, on the whole, we may say that the truth of the
      story was just what they did not trouble about, any more than some
      clergymen are particular about the absolute truth of the stories they tell
      children from the pulpit. The application, the lesson, is the thing!" With
      their desire to interpret Nature spiritually, we ought, I think, to
      sympathise. But there was one truth they had yet to learn, namely, that in
      order to interpret Nature spiritually, it is necessary first to understand
      her aright in her literal sense.

    <h2>
      IX. THE QUEST OF THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE need of unity is a primary need of human thought. Behind the varied
      multiplicity of the world of phenomena, primitive man, as I have indicated
      on a preceding excursion, begins to seek, more or less consciously, for
      that Unity which alone is Real. And this statement not only applies to the
      first dim gropings of the primitive human mind, but sums up almost the
      whole of science and philosophy; for almost all science and philosophy is
      explicitly or implicitly a search for unity, for one law or one love, one
      matter or one spirit. That which is the aim of the search may, indeed, be
      expressed under widely different terms, but it is always conceived to be
      the unity in which all multiplicity is resolved, whether it be thought of
      as one final law of necessity, which all things obey, and of which all the
      various other "laws of nature" are so many special and limited
      applications; or as one final love for which all things are created, and
      to which all things aspire; as one matter of which all bodies are but
      varying forms; or as one spirit, which is the life of all things, and of
      which all things are so many manifestations. Every scientist and
      philosopher is a merchant seeking for goodly pearls, willing to sell every
      pearl that he has, if he may secure the One Pearl beyond price, because he
      knows that in that One Pearl all others are included.
    </p>
    <p>
      This search for unity in multiplicity, however, is not confined to the
      acknowledged scientist and philosopher. More or less unconsciously
      everyone is engaged in this quest. Harmony and unity are the very
      fundamental laws of the human mind itself, and, in a sense, all mental
      activity is the endeavour to bring about a state of harmony and unity in
      the mind. No two ideas that are contradictory of one another, and are
      perceived to be of this nature, can permanently exist in any sane man's
      mind. It is true that many people try to keep certain portions of their
      mental life in water-tight compartments; thus some try to keep their
      religious convictions and their business ideas, or their religious faith
      and their scientific knowledge, separate from another one&mdash;and, it
      seems, often succeed remarkably well in so doing. But, ultimately, the
      arbitrary mental walls they have erected will break down by the force of
      their own ideas. Contradictory ideas from different compartments will then
      present themselves to consciousness at the same moment of time, and the
      result of the perception of their contradictory nature will be mental
      anguish and turmoil, persisting until one set of ideas is conquered and
      overcome by the other, and harmony and unity are restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true of all of us, then, that we seek for Unity&mdash;unity in mind
      and life. Some seek it in science and a life of knowledge; some seek it in
      religion and a life of faith; some seek it in human love and find it in
      the life of service to their fellows; some seek it in pleasure and the
      gratification of the senses' demands; some seek it in the harmonious
      development of all the facets of their being. Many the methods, right and
      wrong; many the terms under which the One is conceived, true and false&mdash;in
      a sense, to use the phraseology of a bygone system of philosophy, we are
      all, consciously or unconsciously, following paths that lead thither or
      paths that lead away, seekers in the quest of the Philosopher's Stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us, in these excursions in the byways of thought, consider for a while
      the form that the quest of fundamental unity took in the hands of those
      curious mediaeval philosophers, half mystics, half experimentalists in
      natural things&mdash;that are known by the name of "alchemists."
    </p>
    <p>
      The common opinion concerning alchemy is that it was a pseudo-science or
      pseudo-art flourishing during the Dark Ages, and having for its aim the
      conversion of common metals into silver and gold by means of a most
      marvellous and wholly fabulous agent called the Philosopher's Stone, that
      its devotees were half knaves, half fools, whose views concerning Nature
      were entirely erroneous, and whose objects were entirely mercenary. This
      opinion is not absolutely destitute of truth; as a science alchemy
      involved many fantastic errors; and in the course of its history it
      certainly proved attractive to both knaves and fools. But if this opinion
      involves some element of truth, it involves a far greater proportion of
      error. Amongst the alchemists are numbered some of the greatest intellects
      of the Middle Ages&mdash;ROGER BACON (<i>c</i>. 1214-1294), for example,
      who might almost be called the father of experimental science. And whether
      or not the desire for material wealth was a secondary object, the true aim
      of the genuine alchemist was a much nobler one than this as one of them
      exclaims with true scientific fervour: "Would to God... all men might
      become adepts in our Art&mdash;for then gold, the great idol of mankind,
      would lose its value, and we should prize it only for its scientific
      teaching."(1) Moreover, recent developments in physical and chemical
      science seem to indicate that the alchemists were not so utterly wrong in
      their concept of Nature as has formerly been supposed&mdash;that, whilst
      they certainly erred in both their methods and their interpretations of
      individual phenomena, they did intuitively grasp certain fundamental facts
      concerning the universe ofthe very greatest importance.

      Suppose, however, that the theories of the alchemists are entirely
      erroneous from beginning to end, and are nowhere relieved by the merest
      glimmer of truth. Still they were believed to be true, and this belief had
      an important influence upon human thought. Many men of science have, I am
      afraid, been too prone to regard the mystical views of the alchemists as
      unintelligible; but, whatever their theories may be to us, these theories
      were certainly very real to them: it is preposterous to maintain that the
      writings of the alchemists are without meaning, even though their views
      are altogether false. And the more false their views are believed to be,
      the more necessary does it become to explain why they should have gained
      such universal credit. Here we have problems into which scientific inquiry
      is not only legitimate, but, I think, very desirable,&mdash;apart
      altogether from the question of the truth or falsity of alchemy as a
      science, or its utility as an art. What exactly was the system of beliefs
      grouped under the term "alchemy," and what was its aim? Why were the
      beliefs held? What was their precise influence upon human thought and
      culture?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in order to elucidate problems of this sort, as well as to
      determine what elements of truth, if any, there are in the theories of the
      alchemists, that The Alchemical Society was founded in 1912, mainly
      through my own efforts and those of my confreres, and for the first time
      something like justice was being done to the memory of the alchemists when
      the Society's activities were stayed by that greatest calamity of history,
      the European War.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some students of the writings of the alchemists have advanced a very
      curious and interesting theory as to the aims of the alchemists, which may
      be termed "the transcendental theory". According to this theory, the
      alchemists were concerned only with the mystical processes affecting the
      soul of man, and their chemical references are only to be understood
      symbolically. In my opinion, however, this view of the subject is rendered
      untenable by the lives of the alchemists themselves; for, as Mr WAITE has
      very fully pointed out in his <i>Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers</i>
      (1888), the lives of the alchemists show them to have been mainly
      concerned with chemical and physical processes; and, indeed, to their
      labours we owe many valuable discoveries of a chemical nature. But the
      fact that such a theory should ever have been formulated, and should not
      be altogether lacking in consistency, may serve to direct our attention to
      the close connection between alchemy and mysticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we wish to understand the origin and aims of alchemy we must endeavour
      to recreate the atmosphere of the Middle Ages, and to look at the subject
      from the point of view of the alchemists themselves. Now, this atmosphere
      was, as I have indicated in a previous essay, surcharged with mystical
      theology and mystical philosophy. Alchemy, so to speak, was generated and
      throve in a dim religious light. We cannot open a book by any one of the
      better sort of alchemists without noticing how closely their theology and
      their chemistry are interwoven, and what a remarkably religious view they
      take of their subject. Thus one alchemist writes: "In the first place, let
      every devout and God-fearing chemist and student of this Art consider that
      this arcanum should be regarded, not only as a truly great, but as a most
      holy Art (seeing that it typifies and shadows out the highest heavenly
      good). Therefore, if any man desire to reach this great and unspeakable
      Mystery, he must remember that it is obtained not by the might of man, but
      by the grace of God, and that not our will or desire, but only the mercy
      of the Most High, can bestow it upon us. For this reason you must first of
      all cleanse your heart, lift it up to Him alone, and ask of Him this gift
      in true, earnest and undoubting prayer. He alone can give and bestow
      it."(1) Whilst another alchemist declares: "I am firmly persuaded that any
      unbeliever who got truly to know this Art, would straightway confess the
      truth of our Blessed Religion, and believe in the Trinity and in our Lord
      JESUS CHRIST."(2)

      Now, what I suggest is that the alchemists constructed their chemical
      theories for the main part by means of <i>a priori</i> reasoning, and that
      the premises from which they started were (i.) the truth of mystical
      theology, especially the doctrine of the soul's regeneration, and (ii.)
      the truth of mystical philosophy, which asserts that the objects of Nature
      are symbols of spiritual verities. There is, I think, abundant evidence to
      show that alchemy was a more or less deliberate attempt to apply,
      according to the principles of analogy, the doctrines of religious
      mysticism to chemical and physical phenomena. Some of this evidence I
      shall attempt to put forward in this essay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, however, I propose to say a few words more in
      description of the theological and philosophical doctrines which so
      greatly influenced the alchemists, and which, I believe, they borrowed for
      their attempted explanations of chemical and physical phenomena. This
      system of doctrine I have termed "mysticism"&mdash;a word which is
      unfortunately equivocal, and has been used to denote various systems of
      religious and philosophical thought, from the noblest to the most
      degraded. I have, therefore, further to define my usage of the term.
    </p>
    <p>
      By mystical theology I mean that system of religious thought which
      emphasises the unity between Creator and creature, though not necessarily
      to the extent of becoming pantheistic. Man, mystical theology asserts, has
      sprung from God, but has fallen away from Him through self-love. Within
      man, however, is the seed of divine grace, whereby, if he will follow the
      narrow road of self-renunciation, he may be regenerated, born anew,
      becoming transformed into the likeness of God and ultimately indissolubly
      united to God in love. God is at once the Creator and the Restorer of
      man's soul, He is the Origin as well as the End of all existence; and He
      is also the Way to that End. In Christian mysticism, CHRIST is the
      Pattern, towards which the mystic strives; CHRIST also is the means
      towards the attainment of this end.
    </p>
    <p>
      By mystical philosophy I mean that system of philosophical thought which
      emphasises the unity of the Cosmos, asserting that God and the spiritual
      may be perceived immanent in the things of this world, because all things
      natural are symbols and emblems of spiritual verities. As one of the <i>Golden
      Verses</i> attributed to PYTHAGORAS, which I have quoted in a previous
      essay, puts it: "The Nature of this Universe is in all things alike";
      commenting upon which, HIEROCLES, writing in the fifth or sixth century,
      remarks that "Nature, in forming this Universe after the Divine Measure
      and Proportion, made it in all things conformable and like to itself,
      analogically in different manners. Of all the different species, diffused
      throughout the whole, it made, as it were, an Image of the Divine Beauty,
      imparting variously to the copy the perfections of the Original."(1) We
      have, however, already encountered so many instances of this belief, that
      no more need be said here concerning it.

      In fine, as Dean INGE well says: "Religious Mysticism may be defined as
      the attempt to realise the presence of the living God in the soul and in
      nature, or, more generally, as <i>the attempt to realise, in thought and
      feeling, the immanence of the temporal in the eternal, and of the eternal
      in the temporal</i>."(2)

      Now, doctrines such as these were not only very prevalent during the
      Middle Ages, when alchemy so greatly flourished, but are of great
      antiquity, and were undoubtedly believed in by the learned class in Egypt
      and elsewhere in the East in those remote days when, as some think,
      alchemy originated, though the evidence, as will, I hope, become plain as
      we proceed, points to a later and post-Christian origin for the central
      theorem of alchemy. So far as we can judge from their writings, the more
      important alchemists were convinced of the truth of these doctrines, and
      it was with such beliefs in mind that they commenced their investigations
      of physical and chemical phenomena. Indeed, if we may judge by the esteem
      in which the Hermetic maxim, "What is above is as that which is below,
      what is below is as that which is above, to accomplish the miracles of the
      One Thing," was held by every alchemist, we are justified in asserting
      that the mystical theory of the spiritual significance of Nature&mdash;a
      theory with which, as we have seen, is closely connected the Neoplatonic
      and Kabalistic doctrine that all things emanate in series from the Divine
      Source of all Being&mdash;was at the very heart of alchemy. As writes one
      alchemist: "... the Sages have been taught of God that this natural world
      is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern;
      that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its
      celestial archetype; and that God has created it in imitation of the
      spiritual and invisible universe, in order that men might be the better
      enabled to comprehend His heavenly teaching, and the wonders of His
      absolute and ineffable power and wisdom. Thus the sage sees heaven
      reflected in Nature as in a mirror; and he pursues this Art, not for the
      sake of gold or silver, but for the love of the knowledge which it
      reveals; he jealously conceals it from the sinner and the scornful, lest
      the mysteries of heaven should be laid bare to the vulgar gaze."(1)

      Concerning Sulphur</i>. (See <i>The Hermetic Museum</i>, vol. ii. p. 138.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The alchemists, I hold, convinced of the truth of this view of Nature, <i>i.e</i>.
      that principles true of one plane of being are true also of all other
      planes, adopted analogy as their guide in dealing with the facts of
      chemistry and physics known to them. They endeavoured to explain these
      facts by an application to them of the principles of mystical theology,
      their chief aim being to prove the truth of these principles as applied to
      the facts of the natural realm, and by studying natural phenomena to
      become instructed in spiritual truth. They did not proceed by the sure,
      but slow, method of modern science, <i>i.e</i>. the method of induction,
      which questions experience at every step in the construction of a theory;
      but they boldly allowed their imaginations to leap ahead and to formulate
      a complete theory of the Cosmos on the strength of but few facts. This led
      them into many fantastic errors, but I would not venture to deny them an
      intuitive perception of certain fundamental truths concerning the
      constitution of the Cosmos, even if they distorted these truths and
      dressed them in a fantastic garb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as I hope to make plain in the course of this excursion, the
      alchemists regarded the discovery of the Philosopher's Stone and the
      transmutation of "base" metals into gold as the consummation of the proof
      of the doctrines of mystical theology as applied to chemical phenomena,
      and it was as such that they so ardently sought to achieve the <i>magnum
      opus</i>, as this transmutation was called. Of course, it would be useless
      to deny that many, accepting the truth of the great alchemical theorem,
      sought for the Philosopher's Stone because of what was claimed for it in
      the way of material benefits. But, as I have already indicated, with the
      nobler alchemists this was not the case, and the desire for wealth, if
      present at all, was merely a secondary object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea expressed in DALTON'S atomic hypothesis (1802), and universally
      held during the nineteenth century, that the material world is made up of
      a certain limited number of elements unalterable in quantity, subject in
      themselves to no change or development, and inconvertible one into
      another, is quite alien to the views of the alchemists. The alchemists
      conceived the universe to be a unity; they believed that all material
      bodies had been developed from one seed; their elements are merely
      different forms of one matter and, therefore, convertible one into
      another. They were thoroughgoing evolutionists with regard to the things
      of the material world, and their theory concerning the evolution of the
      metals was, I believe, the direct outcome of a metallurgical application
      of the mystical doctrine of the soul's development and regeneration. The
      metals, they taught, all spring from the same seed in Nature's womb, but
      are not all equally matured and perfect; for, as they say, although Nature
      always intends to produce only gold, various impurities impede the
      process. In the metals the alchemists saw symbols of man in the various
      stages of his spiritual development. Gold, the most beautiful as well as
      the most untarnishable metal, keeping its beauty permanently, unaffected
      by sulphur, most acids, and fire&mdash;indeed, purified by such treatment,&mdash;gold,
      to the alchemist, was the symbol of regenerate man, and therefore he
      called it "a noble metal". Silver was also termed "noble"; but it was
      regarded as less mature than gold, for, although it is undoubtedly
      beautiful and withstands the action of fire, it is corroded by nitric acid
      and is blackened by sulphur; it was, therefore, considered to be analogous
      to the regenerate man at a lower stage of his development. Possibly we
      shall not be far wrong in using SWEDENBORG'S terms, "celestial" to
      describe the man of gold, "spiritual" to designate him of silver. Lead, on
      the other hand, the alchemists regarded as a very immature and impure
      metal: heavy and dull, corroded by sulphur and nitric acid, and converted
      into a calx by the action of fire,&mdash;lead, to the alchemists, was a
      symbol of man in a sinful and unregenerate condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alchemists assumed the existence of three principles in the metals,
      their obvious reason for so doing being the mystical threefold division of
      man into body, soul (<i>i.e</i>. affections and will), and spirit (<i>i.e</i>.
      intelligence), though the principle corresponding to body was a
      comparatively late introduction in alchemical philosophy. This latter
      fact, however, is no argument against my thesis; because, of course, I do
      not maintain that the alchemists started out with their chemical
      philosophy ready made, but gradually worked it out, by incorporating in it
      further doctrines drawn from mystical theology. The three principles just
      referred to were called "mercury," "sulphur," and "salt"; and they must be
      distinguished from the common bodies so designated (though the alchemists
      themselves seem often guilty of confusing them). "Mercury" is the metallic
      principle <i>par excellence</i>, conferring on metals their brightness and
      fusibility, and corresponding to the spirit or intelligence in man.(1)
      "Sulphur," the principle of combustion and colour, is the analogue of the
      soul. Many alchemists postulated two sulphurs in the metals, an inward and
      an outward.(1b) The outward sulphur was thought to be the chief cause of
      metallic impurity, and the reason why all (known) metals, save gold and
      silver, were acted on by fire. The inward sulphur, on the other hand, was
      regarded as essential to the development of the metals: pure mercury, we
      are told, matured by a pure inward sulphur yields pure gold. Here again it
      is evident that the alchemists borrowed their theories from mystical
      theology; for, clearly, inward sulphur is nothing else than the equivalent
      to love of God; outward sulphur to love of self. Intelligence (mercury)
      matured by love to God (inward sulphur) exactly expresses the spiritual
      state of the regenerate man according to mystical theology. There is no
      reason, other than their belief in analogy, why the alchemists should have
      held such views concerning the metals. "Salt," the principle of solidity
      and resistance to fire, corresponding to the body in man, plays a
      comparatively unimportant part in alchemical theory, as does its prototype
      in mystical theology.

    <p>
      Now, as I have pointed out already, the central theorem of mystical
      theology is, in Christian terminology, that of the regeneration of the
      soul by the Spirit of CHRIST. The corresponding process in alchemy is that
      of the transmutation of the "base" metals into silver and gold by the
      agency of the Philosopher's Stone. Merely to remove the evil sulphur of
      the "base" metals, thought the alchemists, though necessary, is not
      sufficient to transmute them into "noble" metals; a maturing process is
      essential, similar to that which they supposed was effected in Nature's
      womb. Mystical theology teaches that the powers and life of the soul are
      not inherent in it, but are given by the free grace of God. Neither,
      according to the alchemists, are the powers and life of nature in herself,
      but in that immanent spirit, the Soul of the World, that animates her. As
      writes the famous alchemist who adopted the pleasing pseudonym of "BASIL
      VALENTINE" (<i>c</i>. 1600), "the power of growth... is imparted not by
      the earth, but by the life-giving spirit that is in it. If the earth were
      deserted by this spirit, it would be dead, and no longer able to afford
      nourishment to anything. For its sulphur or richness would lack the
      quickening spirit without which there can be neither life nor growth."(1a)
      To perfect the metals, therefore, the alchemists argued, from analogy with
      mystical theology, which teaches that men can be regenerated only by the
      power of CHRIST within the soul, that it is necessary to subject them to
      the action of this world-spirit, this one essence underlying all the
      varied powers of nature, this One Thing from which "all things were
      produced... by adaption, and which is the cause of all perfection
      throughout the whole world."(2a) "This," writes one alchemist, "is the
      Spirit of Truth, which the world cannot comprehend without the
      interposition of the Holy Ghost, or without the instruction of those who
      know it. The same is of a mysterious nature, wondrous strength, boundless
      power.... By Avicenna this Spirit is named the Soul of the World. For, as
      the Soul moves all the limbs of the Body, so also does this Spirit move
      all bodies. And as the Soul is in all the limbs of the Body, so also is
      this Spirit in all elementary created things. It is sought by many and
      found by few. It is beheld from afar and found near; for it exists in
      every thing, in every place, and at all times. It has the powers of all
      creatures; its action is found in all elements, and the qualities of all
      things are therein, even in the highest perfection... it heals all dead
      and living bodies without other medicine... converts all metallic bodies
      into gold, and there is nothing like unto it under Heaven."(1b) It was
      this Spirit, concentrated in all its potency in a suitable material form,
      which the alchemists sought under the name of "the Philosopher's Stone".
      Now, mystical theology teaches that the Spirit of CHRIST, by which alone
      the soul of man can be tinctured and transmuted into the likeness of God,
      is Goodness itself; consequently, the alchemists argued that the
      Philosopher's Stone must be, so to speak, Gold itself, or the very essence
      of Gold: it was to them, as CHRIST is of the soul's perfection, at once
      the pattern and the means of metallic perfection. "The Philosopher's
      Stone," declares "EIRENAEUS PHILALETHES" (<i>nat. c</i>. 1623), "is a
      certain heavenly, spiritual, penetrative, and fixed substance, which
      brings all metals to the perfection of gold or silver (according to the
      quality of the Medicine), and that by natural methods, which yet in their
      effects transcend Nature.... Know, then, that it is called a stone, not
      because it is like a stone, but only because, by virtue of its fixed
      nature, it resists the action of fire as successfully as any stone. In
      species it is gold, more pure than the purest; it is fixed and
      incombustible like a stone (<i>i.e</i>. it contains no outward sulphur,
      but only inward, fixed sulphur), but its appearance is that of a very fine
      powder, impalpable to the touch, sweet to the taste, fragrant to the
      smell, in potency a most penetrative spirit, apparently dry and yet
      unctuous, and easily capable of tingeing a plate of metal.... If we say
      that its nature is spiritual, it would be no more than the truth; if we
      described it as corporeal the expression would be equally correct; for it
      is subtle, penetrative, glorified, spiritual gold. It is the noblest of
      all created things after the rational soul, and has virtue to repair all
      defects both in animal and metallic bodies, by restoring them to the most
      exact and perfect temper; wherefore is it a spirit or 'quintessence.'"(1c)

      In other accounts the Philosopher's Stone, or at least the <i>materia
      prima</i> of which it is compounded, is spoken of as a despised substance,
      reckoned to be of no value. Thus, according to one curious alchemistic
      work, "This matter, so precious by the excellent Gifts, wherewith Nature
      has enriched it, is truly mean, with regard to the Substances from whence
      it derives its Original. Their price is not above the Ability of the Poor.
      Ten Pence is more than sufficient to purchase the Matter of the Stone....
      The matter therefore is mean, considering the Foundation of the Art
      because it costs very little; it is no less mean, if one considers
      exteriourly that which gives it Perfection, since in that regard it costs
      nothing at all, in as much as <i>all the World has it in its Power</i>...
      so that... it is a constant Truth, that the Stone is a Thing mean in one
      Sense, but that in another it is most precious, and that there are none
      but Fools that despise it, by a just Judgment of God."(1) And JACOB BOEHME
      (1575&mdash;1624) writes: "The <i>philosopher's stone</i> is a very dark,
      disesteemed stone, of a grey colour, but therein lieth the highest
      tincture."(2) In these passages there is probably some reference to the
      ubiquity of the Spirit of the World, already referred to in a former
      quotation. But this fact is not, in itself, sufficient to account for
      them. I suggest that their origin is to be found in the religious doctrine
      that God's Grace, the Spirit of CHRIST that is the means of the
      transmutation of man's soul into spiritual gold, is free to all; that it
      is, at once, the meanest and the most precious thing in the whole
      Universe. Indeed, I think it quite probable that the alchemists who penned
      the above-quoted passages had in mind the words of ISAIAH, "He was
      despised and we esteemed him not." And if further evidence is required
      that the alchemists believed in a correspondence between CHRIST&mdash;"the
      Stone which the builders rejected"&mdash;and the Philosopher's Stone,
      reference may be made to the alchemical work called <i>The Sophic
      Hydrolith: or Water Stone of the Wise</i>, a tract included in <i>The
      Hermetic Museum</i>, in which this supposed correspondence is explicitly
      asserted and dealt with in some detail.

    <p>
      Apart from the alchemists' belief in the analogy between natural and
      spiritual things, it is, I think, incredible that any such theories of the
      metals and the possibility of their transmutation or "regeneration" by
      such an extraordinary agent as the Philosopher's Stone would have occurred
      to the ancient investigators of Nature's secrets. When they had started to
      formulate these theories, facts(1) were discovered which appeared to
      support them; but it is, I suggest, practically impossible to suppose that
      any or all of these facts would, in themselves, have been sufficient to
      give rise to such wonderfully fantastic theories as these: it is only from
      the standpoint of the theory that alchemy was a direct offspring of
      mysticism that its origin seems to be capable of explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) One of those facts, amongst many others, that appeared to confirm the
      alchemical doctrines, was the ease with which iron could apparently be
      transmuted into copper. It was early observed that iron vessels placed in
      contact with a solution of blue vitriol became converted (at least, so far
      as their surfaces were concerned) into copper. This we now know to be due
      to the fact that the copper originally contained in the vitriol is thrown
      out of solution, whilst the iron takes its place. And we know, also, that
      no more copper can be obtained in this way from the blue vitriol than is
      actually used up in preparing it; and, further, that all the iron which is
      apparently converted into copper can be got out of the residual solution
      by appropriate methods, if such be desired; so that the facts really
      support DALTON'S theory rather than the alchemical doctrines. But to the
      alchemist it looked like a real transmutation of iron into copper,
      confirmation of his fond belief that iron and other base metals could be
      transmuted into silver and gold by the aid of the Great Arcanum of Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the alchemical doctrines mystical connections are evident, and
      mystical origins can generally be traced. I shall content myself here with
      giving a couple of further examples. Consider, in the first place, the
      alchemical doctrine of purification by putrefaction, that the metals must
      die before they can be resurrected and truly live, that through death
      alone are they purified&mdash;in the more prosaic language of modern
      chemistry, death becomes oxidation, and rebirth becomes reduction. In many
      alchemical books there are to be found pictorial symbols of the
      putrefaction and death of metals and their new birth in the state of
      silver or gold, or as the Stone itself, together with descriptions of
      these processes. The alchemists sought to kill or destroy the body or
      outward form of the metals, in the hope that they might get at and utilise
      the living essence they believed to be immanent within. As PARACELSUS put
      it: "Nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance, but in
      the virtue... the less there is of body, the more in proportion is the
      virtue." It seems to me quite obvious that in such ideas as these we have
      the application to metallurgy of the mystic doctrine of self-renunciation&mdash;that
      the soul must die to self before it can live to God; that the body must be
      sacrificed to the spirit, and the individual will bowed down utterly to
      the One Divine Will, before it can become one therewith.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second place, consider the directions as to the colours that must
      be obtained in the preparation of the Philosopher's Stone, if a successful
      issue to the Great Work is desired. Such directions are frequently given
      in considerable detail in alchemical works; and, without asserting any
      exact uniformity, I think that I may state that practically all the
      alchemists agree that three great colour-stages are necessary&mdash;(i.)
      an inky blackness, which is termed the "Crow's Head" and is indicative of
      putrefaction; (ii.) a white colour indicating that the Stone is now
      capable of converting "base" metals into silver; this passes through
      orange into (iii.) a red colour, which shows that the Stone is now
      perfect, and will transmute "base" metals into gold. Now, what was the
      reason for the belief in these three colour-stages, and for their
      occurrence in the above order? I suggest that no alchemist actually
      obtained these colours in this order in his chemical experiments, and that
      we must look for a speculative origin for the belief in them. We have, I
      think, only to turn to religious mysticism for this origin. For the
      exponents of religious mysticism unanimously agree to a threefold division
      of the life of the mystic. The first stage is called "the dark night of
      the soul," wherein it seems as if the soul were deserted by God, although
      He is very near. It is the time of trial, when self is sacrificed as a
      duty and not as a delight. Afterwards, however, comes the morning light of
      a new intelligence, which marks the commencement of that stage of the
      soul's upward progress that is called the "illuminative life". All the
      mental powers are now concentrated on God, and the struggle is transferred
      from without to the inner man, good works being now done, as it were,
      spontaneously. The disciple, in this stage, not only does unselfish deeds,
      but does them from unselfish motives, being guided by the light of Divine
      Truth. The third stage, which is the consummation of the process, is
      termed "the contemplative life". It is barely describable. The disciple is
      wrapped about with the Divine Love, and is united thereby with his Divine
      Source. It is the life of love, as the illuminative life is that of
      wisdom. I suggest that the alchemists, believing in this threefold
      division of the regenerative process, argued that there must be three
      similar stages in the preparation of the Stone, which was the pattern of
      all metallic perfection; and that they derived their beliefs concerning
      the colours, and other peculiarities of each stage in the supposed
      chemical process, from the characteristics of each stage in the
      psychological process according to mystical theology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, in the course of the latter process many flitting thoughts and
      affections arise and deeds are half-wittingly done which are not of the
      soul's true character; and in entire agreement with this, we read of the
      alchemical process, in the highly esteemed "Canons" of D'ESPAGNET:
      "Besides these decretory signs (<i>i.e</i>. the black, white, orange, and
      red colours) which firmly inhere in the matter, and shew its essential
      mutations, almost infinite colours appear, and shew themselves in vapours,
      as the Rainbow in the clouds, which quickly pass away and are expelled by
      those that succeed, more affecting the air than the earth: the operator
      must have a gentle care of them, because they are not permanent, and
      proceed not from the intrinsic disposition of the matter, but from the
      fire painting and fashioning everything after its pleasure, or casually by
      heat in slight moisture."(1) That D'ESPAGNET is arguing, not so much from
      actual chemical experiments, as from analogy with psychological processes
      in man, is, I think, evident.

      Hermetica</i>, ed. by W. WYNN WESTCOTT, vol. i., 1893, pp. 28 and 29.)
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as a metallic, the alchemists believed in a physiological,
      application of the fundamental doctrines of mysticism: their physiology
      was analogically connected with their metallurgy, the same principles
      holding good in each case. PARACELSUS, as we have seen, taught that man is
      a microcosm, a world in miniature; his spirit, the Divine Spark within, is
      from God; his soul is from the Stars, extracted from the Spirit of the
      World; and his body is from the earth, extracted from the elements of
      which all things material are made. This view of man was shared by many
      other alchemists. The Philosopher's Stone, therefore (or, rather, a
      solution of it in alcohol) was also regarded as the Elixir of Life; which,
      thought the alchemists, would not endow man with physical immortality, as
      is sometimes supposed, but restore him again to the flower of youth,
      "regenerating" him physiologically. Failing this, of course, they regarded
      gold in a potable form as the next most powerful medicine&mdash;a belief
      which probably led to injurious effects in some cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the facts from which I think we are justified in concluding, as I
      have said, "that the alchemists constructed their chemical theories for
      the main part by means of <i>a priori</i> reasoning, and that the premises
      from which they started were (i.) the truth of mystical theology,
      especially the doctrine of the soul's regeneration, and (ii.) the truth of
      mystical philosophy, which asserts that the objects of nature are symbols
      of spiritual verities."(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) In the following excursion we will wander again in the alchemical
      bypaths of thought, and certain objections to this view of the origin and
      nature of alchemy will be dealt with and, I hope, satisfactorily answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to follow, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, that every alchemical work ought
      to permit of two interpretations, one physical, the other transcendental.
      But I would not venture to assert this, because, as I think, many of the
      lesser alchemists knew little of the origin of their theories, nor
      realised their significance. They were concerned merely with these
      theories in their strictly metallurgical applications, and any
      transcendental meaning we can extract from their works was not intended by
      the writers themselves. However, many alchemists, I conceive, especially
      the better sort, realised more or less clearly the dual nature of their
      subject, and their books are to some extent intended to permit of a double
      interpretation, although the emphasis is laid upon the physical and
      chemical application of mystical doctrine. And there are a few writers who
      adopted alchemical terminology on the principle that, if the language of
      theology is competent to describe chemical processes, then, conversely,
      the language of alchemy must be competent to describe psychological
      processes: this is certainly and entirely true of JACOB BOEHME, and, to
      some extent also, I think, of HENRY KHUNRATH (1560-1605) and THOMAS
      VAUGHAN (1622-1666).
    </p>
    <p>
      As may be easily understood, many of the alchemists led most romantic
      lives, often running the risk of torture and death at the hands of
      avaricious princes who believed them to be in possession of the
      Philosopher's Stone, and adopted such pleasant methods of extorting (or,
      at least, of trying to extort) their secrets. A brief sketch, which I
      quote from my <i>Alchemy: Ancient and Modern</i> (1911), SE 54, of the
      lives of ALEXANDER SETHON and MICHAEL SENDIVOGIUS, will serve as an
      example:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The date and birthplace of ALEXANDER SETHON, a Scottish alchemist, do not
      appear to have been recorded, but MICHAEL SENDIVOGIUS was probably born in
      Moravia about 1566. Sethon, we are told, was in possession of the
      arch-secrets of Alchemy. He visited Holland in 1602, proceeded after a
      time to Italy, and passed through Basle to Germany; meanwhile he is said
      to have performed many transmutations. Ultimately arriving at Dresden,
      however, he fell into the clutches of the young Elector, Christian II.,
      who, in order to extort his secret, cast him into prison and put him to
      the torture, but without avail. Now it so happened that Sendivogius, who
      was in quest of the Philosopher's Stone, was staying at Dresden, and
      hearing of Sethon's imprisonment obtained permission to visit him.
      Sendivogius offered to effect Sethon's escape in return for assistance in
      his alchemistic pursuits, to which arrangement the Scottish alchemist
      willingly agreed. After some considerable outlay of money in bribery,
      Sendivogius's plan of escape was successfully carried out, and Sethon
      found himself a free man; but he refused to betray the high secrets of
      Hermetic philosophy to his rescuer. However, before his death, which
      occurred shortly afterwards, he presented him with an ounce of the
      transmutative powder. Sendivogius soon used up this powder, we are told,
      in effecting transmutations and cures, and, being fond of expensive
      living, he married Sethon's widow, in the hope that she was in the
      possession of the transmutative secret. In this, however, he was
      disappointed; she knew nothing of the matter, but she had the manuscript
      of an alchemistic work written by her late husband. Shortly afterwards
      Sendivogius printed at Prague a book entitled <i>The New Chemical Light</i>
      under the name of 'Cosmopolita,' which is said to have been this work of
      Sethon's, but which Sendivogius claimed for his own by the insertion of
      his name on the title page, in the form of an anagram. The tract <i>On
      Sulphur</i> which was printed at the end of the book in later editions,
      however, is said to have been the genuine work of the Moravian. Whilst his
      powder lasted, Sendivogius travelled about, performing, we are told, many
      transmutations. He was twice imprisoned in order to extort the secrets of
      alchemy from him, on one occasion escaping, and on the other occasion
      obtaining his release from the Emperor Rudolph. Afterwards, he appears to
      have degenerated into an impostor, but this is said to have been a <i>finesse</i>
      to hide his true character as an alchemistic adept. He died in 1646."
    </p>
    <p>
      However, all the alchemists were not of the apparent character of
      SENDIVOGIUS&mdash;many of them leading holy and serviceable lives. The
      alchemist-physician J. B. VAN HELMONT (1577-1644), who was a man of
      extraordinary benevolence, going about treating the sick poor freely, may
      be particularly mentioned. He, too, claimed to have performed the
      transmutation of "base" metal into gold, as did also HELVETIUS (whom we
      have already met), physician to the Prince of Orange, with a wonderful
      preparation given to him by a stranger. The testimony of these two latter
      men is very difficult either to explain or to explain away, but I cannot
      deal with this question here, but must refer the reader to a paper on the
      subject by Mr GASTON DE MENGEL, and the discussion thereon, published in
      vol. i. of <i>The Journal of the Alchemical Society</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, I will venture one remark dealing with a matter outside of
      the present inquiry. Alchemy ended its days in failure and fraud;
      charlatans and fools were attracted to it by purely mercenary objects, who
      knew nothing of the high aims of the genuine alchemists, and scientific
      men looked elsewhere for solutions of Nature's problems. Why did alchemy
      fail? Was it because its fundamental theorems were erroneous? I think not.
      I consider the failure of the alchemical theory of Nature to be due rather
      to the misapplication of these fundamental concepts, to the erroneous use
      of <i>a priori</i> methods of reasoning, to a lack of a sufficiently wide
      knowledge of natural phenomena to which to apply these concepts, to a lack
      of adequate apparatus with which to investigate such phenomena
      experimentally, and to a lack of mathematical organons of thought with
      which to interpret such experimental results had they been obtained. As
      for the basic concepts of alchemy themselves, such as the fundamental
      unity of the Cosmos and the evolution of the elements, in a word, the
      applicability of the principles of mysticism to natural phenomena: these
      seem to me to contain a very valuable element of truth&mdash;a statement
      which, I think, modern scientific research justifies me in making,&mdash;though
      the alchemists distorted this truth and expressed it in a fantastic form.
      I think, indeed, that in the modern theories of energy and the
      all-pervading ether, the etheric and electrical origin and nature of
      matter and the evolution of the elements, we may witness the triumphs of
      mysticism as applied to the interpretation of Nature. Whether or not we
      shall ever transmute lead into gold, I believe there is a very true sense
      in which we may say that alchemy, purified by its death, has been proved
      true, whilst the materialistic view of Nature has been proved false.

    <h2>
      X. THE PHALLIC ELEMENT IN ALCHEMICAL DOCTRINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE problem of alchemy presents many aspects to our view, but, to my mind,
      the most fundamental of these is psychological, or, perhaps I should say,
      epistemological. It has been said that the proper study of mankind is man;
      and to study man we must study the beliefs of man. Now so long as we
      neglect great tracts of such beliefs, because they have been, or appear to
      have been, superseded, so long will our study be incomplete and
      ineffectual. And this, let me add, is no mere excuse for the study of
      alchemy, no mere afterthought put forward in justification of a
      predilection, but a plain statement of fact that renders this study an
      imperative need. There are other questions of interest&mdash;of very great
      interest&mdash;concerning alchemy: questions, for instance, as to the
      scope and validity of its doctrines; but we ought not to allow their
      fascination and promise to distract our attention from the fundamental
      problem, whose solution is essential to their elucidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the preceding essay on "The Quest of the Philosopher's Stone," which
      was written from the standpoint I have sketched in the foregoing words, my
      thesis was "that the alchemists constructed their chemical theories for
      the main part by means of <i>a priori</i> reasoning, and that the premises
      from which they started were (i.) the truth of mystical theology,
      especially the doctrine of the soul's regeneration, and (ii.) the truth of
      mystical philosophy, which asserts that the objects of nature are symbols
      of spiritual verities." Now, I wish to treat my present thesis, which is
      concerned with a further source from which the alchemists derived certain
      of their views and modes of expression by means of <i>a priori</i>
      reasoning, in connection with, and, in a sense, as complementary to, my
      former thesis. I propose in the first place, therefore, briefly to deal
      with certain possible objections to this view of alchemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has, for instance, been maintained(1) that the assimilation of
      alchemical doctrines concerning the metals to those of mysticism
      concerning the soul was an event late in the history of alchemy, and was
      undertaken in the interests of the latter doctrines. Now we know that
      certain mystics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries did borrow from
      the alchemists much of their terminology with which to discourse of
      spiritual mysteries&mdash;JACOB BOEHME, HENRY KHUNRATH, and perhaps THOMAS
      VAUGHAN, may be mentioned as the most prominent cases in point. But how
      was this possible if it were not, as I have suggested, the repayment, in a
      sense, of a sort of philological debt? Transmutation was an admirable
      vehicle of language for describing the soul's regeneration, just because
      the doctrine of transmutation was the result of an attempt to apply the
      doctrine of regeneration in the sphere of metallurgy; and similar remarks
      hold of the other prominent doctrines of alchemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) See, for example, Mr A. E. WAITE'S paper, "The Canon of Criticism in
      respect of Alchemical Literature," <i>The Journal of the Alchemical
      Society</i>, vol. i. (1913), pp. 17-30.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wonderful fabric of alchemical doctrine was not woven in a day, and as
      it passed from loom to loom, from Byzantium to Syria, from Syria to
      Arabia, from Arabia to Spain and Latin Europe, so its pattern changed; but
      it was always woven <i>a priori</i>, in the belief that that which is
      below is as that which is above. In its final form, I think, it is
      distinctly Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <i>Turba Philosophorum</i>, the oldest known work of Latin alchemy&mdash;a
      work which, claiming to be of Greek origin, whilst not that, is certainly
      Greek in spirit,&mdash;we frequently come across statements of a decidedly
      mystical character. "The regimen," we read, "is greater than is perceived
      by reason, except through divine inspiration."(1) Copper, it is insisted
      upon again and again, has a soul as well as a body; and the Art, we are
      told, is to be defined as "the liquefaction of the body and the separation
      of the soul from the body, seeing that copper, like a man, has a soul and
      a body."(2) Moreover, other doctrines are here propounded which, although
      not so obviously of a mystical character, have been traced to mystical
      sources in the preceding excursion. There is, for instance, the doctrine
      of purification by means of putrefaction, this process being likened to
      that of the resurrection of man. "These things being done," we read, "God
      will restore unto it (the matter operated on) both the soul and the spirit
      thereof, and the weakness being taken away, that matter will be made
      strong, and after corruption will be improved, even as a man becomes
      stronger after resurrection and younger than he was in this world."(1b)
      The three stages in the alchemical work&mdash;black, white, and red&mdash;corresponding
      to, and, as I maintain, based on the three stages in the life of the
      mystic, are also more than once mentioned. "Cook them (the king and his
      wife), therefore, until they become black, then white, afterwards red, and
      finally until a tingeing venom is produced."(2b)

      In view of these quotations, the alliance (shall I say?) between alchemy
      and mysticism cannot be asserted to be of late origin. And we shall find
      similar statements if we go further back in time. To give but one example:
      "Among the earliest authorities," writes Mr WAITE, "the <i>Book of Crates</i>
      says that copper, like man, has a spirit, soul, and body," the term
      "copper" being symbolical and applying to a stage in the alchemical work.
      But nowhere in the <i>Turba</i> do we meet with the concept of the
      Philosopher's Stone as the medicine of the metals, a concept
      characteristic of Latin alchemy, and, to quote Mr WAITE again, "it does
      not appear that the conception of the Philosopher's Stone as a medicine of
      metals and of men was familiar to Greek alchemy;"(3)
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      All this seems to me very strongly to support my view of the origin of
      alchemy, which requires a specifically Christian mysticism only for this
      specific concept of the Philosopher's Stone in its fully-fledged form. At
      any rate, the development of alchemical doctrine can be seen to have
      proceeded concomitantly with the development of mystical philosophy and
      theology. Those who are not prepared here to see effect and cause may be
      asked not only to formulate some other hypothesis in explanation of the
      origin of alchemy, but also to explain this fact of concomitant
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the standpoint of the transcendental theory of alchemy it has been
      urged "that the language of mystical theology seemed to be hardly so
      suitable to the exposition (as I maintain) or concealment of chemical
      theories, as the language of a definite and generally credited branch of
      science was suited to the expression of a veiled and symbolical process
      such as the regeneration of man."(1) But such a statement is only possible
      with respect to the latest days of alchemy, when there WAS a science of
      chemistry, definite and generally credited. The science of chemistry, it
      must be remembered, had no growth separate from alchemy, but evolved
      therefrom. Of the days before this evolution had been accomplished, it
      would be in closer accord with the facts to say that theology, including
      the doctrine of man's regeneration, was in the position of "a definite and
      generally credited branch of science," whereas chemical phenomena were
      veiled in deepest mystery and tinged with the dangers appertaining to
      magic. As concerns the origin of alchemy, therefore, the argument as to
      suitability of language appears to support my own theory; it being open to
      assume that after formulation&mdash;that is, in alchemy's latter days&mdash;chemical
      nomenclature and theories were employed by certain writers to veil
      heterodox religious doctrine.

      Another recent writer on the subject, my friend the late Mr ABDUL-ALI, has
      remarked that "he thought that, in the mind of the alchemist at least,
      there was something more than analogy between metallic and psychic
      transformations, and that the whole subject might well be assigned to the
      doctrinal category of ineffable and transcendent Oneness. This Oneness
      comprehended all&mdash;soul and body, spirit and matter, mystic visions
      and waking life&mdash;and the sharp metaphysical distinction between the
      mental and the non-mental realms, so prominent during the history of
      philosophy, was not regarded by these early investigators in the sphere of
      nature. There was the sentiment, perhaps only dimly experienced, that not
      only the law, but the substance of the Universe, was one; that mind was
      everywhere in contact with its own kindred; and that metallic
      transmutation would, somehow, so to speak, signalise and seal a hidden
      transmutation of the soul."(1)

    </p>
    <p>
      I am to a large extent in agreement with this view. Mr ABDUL-ALI quarrels
      with the term "analogy," and, if it is held to imply any merely
      superficial resemblance, it certainly is not adequate to my own needs,
      though I know not what other word to use. SWEDENBORG'S term
      "correspondence" would be better for my purpose, as standing for an
      essential connection between spirit and matter, arising out of the causal
      relationship of the one to the other. But if SWEDENBORG believed that
      matter and spirit were most intimately related, he nevertheless had a very
      precise idea of their distinctness, which he formulated in his Doctrine of
      Degrees&mdash;a very exact metaphysical doctrine indeed. The alchemists,
      on the other hand, had no such clear ideas on the subject. It would be
      even more absurd to attribute to them a Cartesian dualism. To their ways
      of thinking, it was by no means impossible to grasp the spiritual essences
      of things by what we should now call chemical manipulations. For them a
      gas was still a ghost and air a spirit. One could quote pages in support
      of this, but I will content myself with a few words from the <i>Turba</i>&mdash;the
      antiquity of the book makes it of value, and anyway it is near at hand.
      "Permanent water," whatever that may be, being pounded with the body, we
      are told, "by the will of God it turns that body into spirit." And in
      another place we read that "the Philosophers have said: Except ye turn
      bodies into not-bodies, and incorporeal things into bodies, ye have not
      yet discovered the rule of operation."(1a) No one who could write like
      this, and believe it, could hold matter and spirit as altogether distinct.
      But it is equally obvious that the injunction to convert body into spirit
      is meaningless if spirit and body are held to be identical. I have been
      criticised for crediting the alchemists "with the philosophic acumen of
      Hegel,"(1b) but that is just what I think one ought to avoid doing. At the
      same time, however, it is extremely difficult to give a precise account of
      views which are very far from being precise themselves. But I think it may
      be said, without fear of error, that the alchemist who could say, "As
      above, so below," <i>ipso facto</i> recognised both a very close
      connection between spirit and matter, and a distinction between them.
      Moreover, the division thus implied corresponded, on the whole, to that
      between the realms of the known (or what was thought to be known) and the
      unknown. The Church, whether Christian or pre-Christian, had very precise
      (comparatively speaking) doctrine concerning the soul's origin, duties,
      and destiny, backed up by tremendous authority, and speculative philosophy
      had advanced very far by the time PLATO began to concern himself with its
      problems. Nature, on the other hand, was a mysterious world of magical
      happenings, and there was nothing deserving of the name of natural science
      until alchemy was becoming decadent. It is not surprising, therefore, that
      the alchemists&mdash;these men who wished to probe Nature's hidden
      mysteries&mdash;should reason from above to below; indeed, unless they had
      started <i>de novo</i>&mdash;as babes knowing nothing,&mdash;there was no
      other course open to them. And that they did adopt the obvious course is
      all that my former thesis amounts to. In passing, it is interesting to
      note that a sixteenth-century alchemist, who had exceptional opportunities
      and leisure to study the works of the old masters of alchemy, seems to
      have come to a similar conclusion as to the nature of their reasoning. He
      writes: "The Sages... after having conceived in their minds a Divine idea
      of the relations of the whole universe... selected from among the rest a
      certain substance, from which they sought to elicit the elements, to
      separate and purify them, and then again put them together in a manner
      suggested by a keen and profound observation of Nature."(1c)

    <p>
      In describing the realm of spirit as <i>ex hypothesi</i> known, that of
      Nature unknown, to the alchemists, I have made one important omission, and
      that, if I may use the name of a science to denominate a complex of crude
      facts, is the realm of physiology, which, falling within that of Nature,
      must yet be classed as <i>ex hypothesi</i> known. But to elucidate this
      point some further considerations are necessary touching the general
      nature of knowledge. Now, facts may be roughly classed, according to their
      obviousness and frequency of occurrence, into four groups. There are,
      first of all, facts which are so obvious, to put it paradoxically, that
      they escape notice; and these facts are the commonest and most frequent in
      their occurrence. I think it is Mr CHESTERTON who has said that, looking
      at a forest one cannot see the trees because of the forest; and, in <i>The
      Innocence of Father Brown</i>, he has a good story ("The Invisible Man")
      illustrating the point, in which a man renders himself invisible by
      dressing up in a postman's uniform. At any rate, we know that when a
      phenomenon becomes persistent it tends to escape observation; thus,
      continuous motion can only be appreciated with reference to a stationary
      body, and a noise, continually repeated, becomes at last inaudible. The
      tendency of often-repeated actions to become habitual, and at last
      automatic, that is to say, carried out without consciousness, is a closely
      related phenomenon. We can understand, therefore, why a knowledge of the
      existence of the atmosphere, as distinct from the wind, came late in the
      history of primitive man, as, also, many other curious gaps in his
      knowledge. In the second group we may put those facts which are common,
      that is, of frequent occurrence, and are classed as obvious. Such facts
      are accepted at face-value by the primitive mind, and are used as the
      basis of explanation of facts in the two remaining groups, namely, those
      facts which, though common, are apt to escape the attention owing to their
      inconspicuousness, and those which are of infrequent occurrence. When the
      mind takes the trouble to observe a fact of the third group, or is
      confronted by one of the fourth, it feels a sense of surprise. Such facts
      wear an air of strangeness, and the mind can only rest satisfied when it
      has shown them to itself as in some way cases of the second group of
      facts, or, at least, brought them into relation therewith. That is what
      the mind&mdash;at least the primitive mind&mdash;means by "explanation".
      "It is obvious," we say, commencing an argument, thereby proclaiming our
      intention to bring that which is at first in the category of the
      not-obvious, into the category of the obvious. It remains for a more
      sceptical type of mind&mdash;a later product of human evolution&mdash;to
      question obvious facts, to explain them, either, as in science, by
      establishing deeper and more far-reaching correlations between phenomena,
      or in philosophy, by seeking for the source and purpose of such facts, or,
      better still, by both methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the second class of facts&mdash;those common and obvious facts which
      the primitive mind accepts at face-value and uses as the basis of its
      explanations of such things as seem to it to stand in need of explanation&mdash;one
      could hardly find a better instance than sex. The universality of sex, and
      the intermittent character of its phenomena, are both responsible for
      this. Indeed, the attitude of mind I have referred to is not restricted to
      primitive man; how many people to-day, for instance, just accept sex as a
      fact, pleasant or unpleasant according to their predilections, never
      querying, or feeling the need to query, its why and wherefore? It is by no
      means surprising, that when man first felt the need of satisfying himself
      as to the origin of the universe, he should have done so by a theory
      founded on what he knew of his own generation. Indeed, as I queried on a
      former occasion, what other source of explanation was open to him? Of what
      other form of origin was he aware? Seeing Nature springing to life at the
      kiss of the sun, what more natural than that she should be regarded as the
      divine Mother, who bears fruits because impregnated by the Sun-God? It is
      not difficult to understand, therefore, why primitive man paid divine
      honours to the organs of sex in man and woman, or to such things as he
      considered symbolical of them&mdash;that is to say, to understand the
      extensiveness of those religions which are grouped under the term
      "phallicism". Nor, to my mind, is the symbol of sex a wholly inadequate
      one under which to conceive of the origin of things. And, as I have said
      before, that phallicism usually appears to have degenerated into
      immorality of a very pronounced type is to be deplored, but an immoral
      view of human relations is by no means a necessary corollary to a sexual
      theory of the universe.(1)

      (1) "The reverence as well as the worship paid to the phallus, in early
      and primitive days, had nothing in it which partook of indecency; all
      ideas connected with it were of a reverential and religious kind....
    </p>
    <p>
      "The indecent ideas attached to the representation of the phallus were,

      civilization verging towards its decline, as we have evidence at Rome and
      Pompeii....

      "To the primitive man (the reproductive force which pervades all nature)
      was the most mysterious of all manifestations. The visible physical powers
      of nature&mdash;the sun, the sky, the storm&mdash;naturally claimed his
      reverence, but to him the generative power was the most mysterious of all
      powers. In the vegetable world, the live seed placed in the ground, and
      hence germinating, sprouting up, and becoming a beautiful and umbrageous
      tree, was a mystery. In the animal world, as the cause of all life, by
      which all beings came into existence, this power was a mystery. In the
      view of primitive man generation was the action of the Deity itself. It
      was the mode in which He brought all things into existence, the sun, the
      moon, the stars, the world, man were generated by Him. To the productive
      power man was deeply indebted, for to it he owed the harvests and the
      flocks which supported his life; hence it naturally became an object of
      reverence and worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Primitive man wants some object to worship, for an abstract idea is
      beyond his comprehension, hence a visible representation of the generative
      Deity was made, with the organs contributing to generation most prominent,
      and hence the organ itself became a symbol of the power."&mdash;H, M.

      The Aruntas of Australia, I believe, when discovered by Europeans, had not
      yet observed the connection between sexual intercourse and birth. They
      believed that conception was occasioned by the woman passing near a <i>churinga</i>&mdash;a
      peculiarly shaped piece of wood or stone, in which a spirit-child was
      concealed, which entered into her. But archaeological research having
      established the fact that phallicism has, at one time or another, been
      common to nearly all races, it seems probable that the Arunta tribe
      represents a deviation from the normal line of mental evolution. At any
      rate, an isolated phenomenon, such as this, cannot be held to controvert
      the view that regards phallicism as in this normal line. Nor was the
      attitude of mind that not only accepts sex at face-value as an obvious
      fact, but uses the concept of it to explain other facts, a merely
      transitory one. We may, indeed, not difficultly trace it throughout the
      history of alchemy, giving rise to what I may term "The Phallic Element in
      Alchemical Doctrine".
    </p>
    <p>
      In aiming to establish this, I may be thought to be endeavouring to
      establish a counter-thesis to that of the preceding essay on alchemy, but,
      in virtue of the alchemists' belief in the mystical unity of all things,
      in the analogical or correspondential relationship of all parts of the
      universe to each other, the mystical and the phallic views of the origin
      of alchemy are complementary, not antagonistic. Indeed, the assumption
      that the metals are the symbols of man almost necessitates the working out
      of physiological as well as mystical analogies, and these two series of
      analogies are themselves connected, because the principle "As above, so
      below" was held to be true of man himself. We might, therefore, expect to
      find a more or less complete harmony between the two series of symbols,
      though, as a matter of fact, contradictions will be encountered when we
      come to consider points of detail. The undoubtable antiquity of the
      phallic element in alchemical doctrine precludes the idea that this
      element was an adventitious one, that it was in any sense an afterthought;
      notwithstanding, however, the evidence, as will, I hope, become apparent
      as we proceed, indicates that mystical ideas played a much more
      fundamental part in the genesis of alchemical doctrine than purely phallic
      ones&mdash;mystical interpretations fit alchemical processes and theories
      far better than do sexual interpretations; in fact, sex has to be
      interpreted somewhat mystically in order to work out the analogies fully
      and satisfactorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      As concerns Greek alchemy, I shall content myself with a passage from a
      work <i>On the Sacred Art</i>, attributed to OLYMPIODORUS (sixth century
      A.D.), followed by some quotations from and references to the <i>Turba</i>.
      In the former work it is stated on the authority of HORUS that "The proper
      end of the whole art is to obtain the semen of the male secretly, seeing
      that all things are male and female. Hence (we read further) Horus says in
      a certain place: Join the male and the female, and you will find that
      which is sought; as a fact, without this process of re-union, nothing can
      succeed, for Nature charms Nature," <i>etc</i>. The <i>Turba</i>
      insistently commands those who would succeed in the Art, to conjoin the
      male with the female,(1) and, in one place, the male is said to be lead
      and the female orpiment.(2) We also find the alchemical work symbolised by
      the growth of the embryo in the womb. "Know," we are told, "... that out
      of the elect things nothing becomes useful without conjunction and
      regimen, because sperma is generated out of blood and desire. For the man
      mingling with the woman, the sperm is nourished by the humour of the womb,
      and by the moistening blood, and by heat, and when forty nights have
      elapsed the sperm is formed.... God has constituted that heat and blood
      for the nourishment of the sperm until the foetus is brought forth. So
      long as it is little, it is nourished with milk, and in proportion as the
      vital heat is maintained, the bones are strengthened. Thus it behoves you
      also to act in this Art."(3)

      The use of the mystical symbols of death (putrefaction) and resurrection
      or rebirth to represent the consummation of the alchemical work, and that
      of the phallic symbols of the conjunction of the sexes and the development
      of the foetus, both of which we have found in the <i>Turba</i>, are
      current throughout the course of Latin alchemy. In <i>The Chymical
      Marriage of Christian Rosencreutz</i>, that extraordinary document of what
      is called "Rosicrucianism"&mdash;a symbolic romance of considerable
      ability, whoever its author was,(1)&mdash;an attempt is made to weld the
      two sets of symbols&mdash;the one of marriage, the other of death and
      resurrection unto glory&mdash;into one allegorical narrative; and it is to
      this fusion of seemingly disparate concepts that much of its
      fantasticality is due. Yet the concepts are not really disparate; for not
      only is the second birth like unto the first, and not only is the
      resurrection unto glory described as the Bridal Feast of the Lamb, but
      marriage is, in a manner, a form of death and rebirth. To justify this in
      a crude sense, I might say that, from the male standpoint at least, it is
      a giving of the life-substance to the beloved that life may be born anew
      and increase. But in a deeper sense it is, or rather should be, as an
      ideal, a mutual sacrifice of self for each other's good&mdash;a death of
      the self that it may arise with an enriched personality.

      It is when we come to an examination of the ideas at the root of, and
      associated with, the alchemical concept of "principles," that we find some
      difficulty in harmonising the two series of symbols&mdash;the mystical and
      the phallic. In one place in the <i>Turba</i> we are directed "to take
      quicksilver, in which is the male potency or strength";(2a) and this
      concept of mercury as male is quite in accord with the mystical origin I
      have assigned in the preceding excursion to the doctrine of the alchemical
      principles. I have shown, I think, that salt, sulphur, and mercury are the
      analogues <i>ex hypothesi</i> of the body, soul (affection and volition),
      and spirit (intelligence or understanding) in man; and the affections are
      invariably regarded as especially feminine, the understanding as
      especially masculine. But it seems that the more common opinion, amongst
      Latin alchemists at any rate, was that sulphur was male and mercury
      female. Writes BERNARD of TREVISAN: "For the Matter suffereth, and the
      Form acteth assimulating the Matter to itself, and according to this
      manner the Matter naturally thirsteth after a Form, as a Woman desireth an
      Husband, and a Vile thing a precious one, and an impure a pure one, so
      also <i>Argent-vive</i> coveteth a Sulphur, as that which should make
      perfect which is imperfect: So also a Body freely desireth a Spirit,
      whereby it may at length arrive at its perfection."(1b) At the same time,
      however, Mercury was regarded as containing in itself both male and female
      potencies&mdash;it was the product of male and female, and, thus, the seed
      of all the metals. "Nothing in the World can be generated," to repeat a
      quotation from BERNARD, without these two Substances, to wit a Male and
      Female: From whence it appeareth, that although these two substances are
      not of one and the same species, yet one Stone doth thence arise, and
      although they appear and are said to be two Substances, yet in truth it is
      but one, to wit, <i>Argent-vive</i>. But of this <i>Argent-vive</i> a
      certain part is fixed and digested, Masculine, hot, dry and secretly
      informing. But the other, which is the Female, is volatile, crude, cold,
      and moyst."(2b) EDWARD KELLY (1555-1595), who is valuable because he
      summarises authoritative opinion, says somewhat the same thing, though in
      clearer words: "The active elements... these are water and fire... may be
      called male, while the passive elements... earth and air... represent the
      female principle.... Only two elements, water and earth, are visible, and
      earth is called the hiding-place of fire, water the abode of air. In these
      two elements we have the broad law of limitation which divides the male
      from the female. ... The first matter of minerals is a kind of viscous
      water, mingled with pure and impure earth... Of this viscous water and
      fusible earth, or sulphur, is composed that which is called quicksilver,
      the first matter of the metals. Metals are nothing but Mercury digested by
      different degrees of heat."(1c) There is one difference, however, between
      these two writers, inasmuch as BERNARD says that "the Male and Female
      abide together in closed Natures; the Female truly as it were Earth and
      Water, the Male as Air and Fire." Mercury for him arises from the two
      former elements, sulphur from the two latter.(2c) And the difference is
      important as showing beyond question the <i>a priori</i> nature of
      alchemical reasoning. The idea at the back of the alchemists' minds was
      undoubtedly that of the ardour of the male in the act of coition and the
      alleged, or perhaps I should say apparent, passivity of the female.
      Consequently, sulphur, the fiery principle of combustion, and such
      elements as were reckoned to be active, were denominated "male," whilst
      mercury, the principle acted on by sulphur, and such elements as were
      reckoned to be passive, were denominated "female". As to the question of
      origin, I do not think that the palm can be denied to the mystical as
      distinguished from the phallic theory. And in its final form the doctrine
      of principles is incapable of a sexual interpretation. Mystically
      understood, man is capable of analysis into two principles&mdash;since
      "body" may be neglected as unimportant (a false view, I think, by the way)
      or "soul" and "spirit" may be united under one head&mdash;OR into three;
      whereas the postulation of THREE principles on a sexual basis is
      impossible. JOANNES ISAACUS HOLLANDUS (fifteenth century) is the earliest
      author in whose works I have observed explicit mention of THREE
      principles, though he refers to them in a manner seeming to indicate that
      the doctrine was no new one in his day. I have only read one little tract
      of his; there is nothing sexual in it, and the author's mental character
      may be judged from his remarks concerning "the three flying spirits"&mdash;taste,
      smell, and colour. These, he writes, "are the life, soule, and
      quintessence of every thing, neither can these three spirits be one
      without the other, as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one, yet
      three Persons, and one is not without the other."(1d)

      When the alchemists described an element or principle as male or female,
      they meant what they said, as I have already intimated, to the extent, at
      least, of firmly believing that seed was produced by the two metallic
      sexes. By their union metals were thought to be produced in the womb of
      the earth; and mines were shut in order that by the birth and growth of
      new metal the impoverished veins might be replenished. In this way, too,
      was the <i>magnum opus</i>, the generation of the Philosopher's Stone&mdash;in
      species gold, but purer than the purest&mdash;to be accomplished. To
      conjoin that which Nature supplied, to foster the growth and development
      of that which was thereby produced; such was the task of the alchemist.
      "For there are Vegetables," says BERNARD of TREVISAN in his <i>Answer to
      Thomas of Bononia</i>, "but Sensitives more especially, which for the most
      part beget their like, by the Seeds of the Male and Female for the most
      part concurring and conmixt by copulation; which work of Nature the
      Philosophick Art imitates in the generation of gold."(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) <i>Op. cit</i>., p. 216.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercury, as I have said, was commonly regarded as the seed of the metals,
      or as especially the female seed, there being two seeds, one the male,
      according to BERNARD, more ripe, perfect and active, the other the female.
      "more immature and in a sort passive(2) "... our Philosophick Art," he
      says in another place, following a description of the generation of man,
      "... is like this procreation of Man; for as in <i>Mercury</i> (of which
      Gold is by Nature generated in Mineral Vessels) a natural conjunction
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) <i>Ibid</i>., p. 217; <i>cf</i>. p. 236
    </p>
    <p>
      is made of both the Seeds, Male and Female, so by our artifice, an
      artificial and like conjunction is made of Agents and Patients."(1) "All
      teaching," says KELLY, "that changes Mercury is false and vain, for this
      is the original sperm of metals, and its moisture must not be dried up,
      for otherwise it will not dissolve,"(2) and quotes ARNOLD (<i>ob. c</i>.
      1310) to a similar effect.(3) One wonders how far the fact that human and
      animal seed is fluid influenced the alchemists in their choice of mercury,
      the only metal liquid at ordinary temperatures, as the seed of the metals.
      There are, indeed, other good reasons for this choice, but that this idea
      played some part in it, and, at least, was present at the back of the
      alchemists' minds, I have little doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most philosophic account of metallic seed is that, perhaps, of the
      mysterious adept "EIRENAEUS PHILALETHES," who distinguishes between it and
      mercury in a rather interesting manner. He writes: "Seed is the means of
      generic propagation given to all perfect things here below; it is the
      perfection of each body; and anybody that has no seed must be regarded as
      imperfect. Hence there can be no doubt that there is such a thing as
      metallic seed.... All metallic seed is the seed of gold; for gold is the
      intention of Nature in regard to all metals. If the base metals are not
      gold, it is only through some accidental hindrance; they are-all
      potentially gold. But, of course, this seed of gold is most easily
      obtainable from well-matured gold itself.... Remember that I am now
      speaking of metallic seed, and not of Mercury.... The seed of metals is
      hidden out of sight still more completely than that of animals;
      nevertheless, it is within the compass of our Art to extract it. The seed
      of animals and vegetables is something separate, and may be cut out, or
      otherwise separately exhibited; but metallic seed is diffused throughout
      the metal, and contained in all its smallest parts; neither can it be
      discerned from its body: its extraction is therefore a task which may well
      tax the ingenuity of the most experienced philosopher; the virtues of the
      whole metal have to be intensified, so as to convert it into the sperm of
      our seed, which, by circulation, receives the virtues of superiors and
      inferiors, then next becomes wholly form, or heavenly virtue, which can
      communicate this to others related to it by homogeneity of matter. ... The
      place in which the seed resides is&mdash;approximately speaking&mdash;water;
      for, to speak properly and exactly, the seed is the smallest part of the
      metal, and is invisible; but as this invisible presence is diffused
      throughout the water of its kind, and exerts its virtue therein, nothing
      being visible to the eye but water, we are left to conclude from rational
      induction that this inward agent (which is, properly speaking, the seed)
      is really there. Hence we call the whole of the water seed, just as we
      call the whole of the grain seed, though the germ of life is only a
      smallest particle of the grain."(1b)

      To say that "PHILALETHES'" seed resembles the modern electron is, perhaps,
      to draw a rather fanciful analogy, since the electron is a very precise
      idea, the result of the mathematical interpretation of the results of
      exact experimentation. But though it would be absurd to speak of this
      concept of the one seed of all metals as an anticipation of the electron,
      to apply the expression "metallic seed" to the electron, now that the
      concept of it has been reached, does not seem so absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to "PHILALETHES," the extraction of the seed is a very difficult
      process, accomplishable, however, by the aid of mercury&mdash;the water
      homogeneous therewith. Mercury, again, is the form of the seed thereby
      obtained. He writes: "When the sperm hidden in the body of gold is brought
      out by means of our Art, it appears under the form of Mercury, whence it
      is exalted into the quintessence which is first white, and then, by means
      of continuous coction, becomes red." And again: "There is a womb into
      which the gold (if placed therein) will, of its own accord, emit its seed,
      until it is debilitated and dies, and by its death is renewed into a most
      glorious King, who thenceforward receives power to deliver all his
      brethren from the fear of death."(1)

      The fifteenth-century alchemist THOMAS NORTON was peculiar in his views,
      inasmuch as he denied that metals have seed. He writes: "Nature never
      multiplies anything, except in either one or the other of these two ways:
      either by decay, which we call putrefaction, or, in the case of animate
      creatures, by propagation. In the case of metals there can be no
      propagation, though our Stone exhibits something like it.... Nothing can
      be multiplied by inward action unless it belong to the vegetable kingdom,
      or the family of sensitive creatures. But the metals are elementary
      objects, and possess neither seed nor sensation."(1)

      His theory of the origin of the metals is astral rather than phallic. "The
      only efficient cause of metals," he says, "is the mineral virtue, which is
      not found in every kind of earth, but only in certain places and chosen
      mines, into which the celestial sphere pours its rays in a straight
      direction year by year, and according to the arrangement of the metallic
      substance in these places, this or that metal is gradually formed."(2)

      In view of the astrological symbolism of these metals, that gold should be
      masculine, silver feminine, does not surprise us, because the idea of the
      masculinity of the sun and the femininity of the moon is a bit of
      phallicism that still remains with us. It was by the marriage of gold and
      silver that very many alchemists considered that the <i>magnum opus</i>
      was to be achieved. Writes BERNARD of TREVISAN: "The subject of this
      admired Science (alchemy) is <i>Sol</i> and <i>Luna</i>, or rather Male
      and Female, the Male is hot and dry, the Female cold and moyst." The aim
      of the work, he tells us, is the extraction of the spirit of gold, which
      alone can enter into bodies and tinge them. Both <i>Sol</i> and <i>Luna</i>
      are absolutely necessary, and "whoever...shall think that a Tincture can
      be made without these two Bodyes,... he proceedeth to the Practice like
      one that is blind."(1)

      KELLY has teaching to the same effect, the Mercury of the Philosophers
      being for him the menstruum or medium wherein the copulation of Gold with
      Silver is to be accomplished. Mercury, in fact, seems to have been
      everything and to have been capable of effecting everything in the eyes of
      the alchemists. Concerning gold and silver, KELLY writes: "Only one metal,
      viz. gold, is absolutely perfect and mature. Hence it is called the
      perfect male body... Silver is less bounded by aqueous immaturity than the
      rest of the metals, though it may indeed be regarded as to a certain
      extent impure, still its water is already covered with the congealing
      vesture of its earth, and it thus tends to perfection. This condition is
      the reason why silver is everywhere called by the Sages the perfect female
      body." And later he writes: "In short, our whole Magistery consists in the
      union of the male and female, or active and passive, elements through the
      mediation of our metallic water and a proper degree of heat. Now, the male
      and female are two metallic bodies, and this I will again prove by
      irrefragable quotations from the Sages." Some of the quotations will be
      given: "Avicenna: 'Purify husband and wife separately, in order that they
      may unite more intimately; for if you do not purify them, they cannot love
      each other. By conjunction of the two natures you get a clear and lucid
      nature, which, when it ascends, becomes bright and serviceable.'...
      Senior: 'I, the Sun, am hot and dry, and thou, the Moon, are cold and
      moist; when we are wedded together in a closed chamber, I will gently
      steal away thy soul.'... Rosinus: 'When the Sun, my brother, for the love
      of me (silver) pours his sperm (<i>i.e</i>. his solar fatness) into the
      chamber (<i>i.e</i>. my Lunar body), namely, when we become one in a
      strong and complete complexion and union, the child of our wedded love
      will be born.... 'Rosary': 'The ferment of the Sun is the sperm of the
      man, the ferment of the Moon, the sperm of the woman. Of both we get a
      chaste union and a true generation.'... Aristotle: 'Take your beloved son,
      and wed him to his sister, his white sister, in equal marriage, and give
      them the cup of love, for it is a food which prompts to union.' "(1a)
      KELLY, of course, accepts the traditional authorship of the works from
      which he quotes, though in many cases such authorship is doubtful, to say
      the least. The alchemical works ascribed to ARISTOTLE (384-322 B.C.), for
      instance, are beyond question forgeries. Indeed, the symbol of a union
      between brother and sister, here quoted, could hardly be held as
      acceptable to Greek thought, to which incest was the most abominable and
      unforgiveable sin. It seems likelier that it originated with the
      Egyptians, to whom such unions were tolerable in fact. The symbol is often
      met with in Latin alchemy. MICHAEL MAIER (1568-1622) also says: "<i>conjunge
      fratrem cum sorore et propina illis poculum amoris</i>," the words forming
      a motto to a picture of a man and woman clasped in each other's arms, to
      whom an older man offers a goblet. This symbolic picture occurs in his <i>Atalanta
      Fugiens, hoc est, Emblemata nova de Secretis Naturae Chymica, etc</i>.
      (Oppenheim, 1617). This work is an exceedingly curious one. It consists of
      a number of carefully executed pictures, each accompanied by a motto, a
      verse of poetry set to music, with a prose text. Many of the pictures are
      phallic in conception, and practically all of them are anthropomorphic.
      Not only the primary function of sex, but especially its secondary one of
      lactation, is made use of. The most curious of these emblematic pictures,
      perhaps, is one symbolising the conjunction of gold and silver. It shows
      on the right a man and woman, representing the sun and moon, in the act of
      coition, standing up to the thighs in a lake. On the left, on a hill above
      the lake, a woman (with the moon as halo) gives birth to a child. A boy is
      coming out of the water towards her. The verse informs us that: "The bath
      glows red at the conception of the boy, the air at his birth." We learn
      also that "there is a stone, and yet there is not, which is the noble gift
      of God. If God grants it, fortunate will be he who shall receive it."(1)

      Concerning the nature of gold, there is a discussion in <i>The Answer of</i>
      BERNARDUS TREVISANUS <i>to the Epistle of Thomas of Bononia</i>, with
      which I shall close my consideration of the present aspect of the subject.
      Its interest for us lies in the arguments which are used and held to be
      valid. "Besides, you say that Gold, as most think, is nothing else than <i>Quick-silver</i>
      coagulated naturally by the force of <i>Sulphur</i>; yet so, that nothing
      of the <i>Sulphur</i> which generated the Gold, doth remain in the
      substance of the Gold: as in an humane <i>Embryo</i>, when it is conceived
      in the Womb, there remains nothing of the Father's Seed, according to <i>Aristotle's</i>
      opinion, but the Seed of the Man doth only coagulate the <i>menstrual</i>
      blood of the Woman: in the same manner you say, that after <i>Quick-silver</i>
      is so coagulated, the form of Gold is perfected in it, by virtue of the
      Heavenly Bodies, and especially of the Sun."(1) BERNARD, however, decides
      against this view, holding that gold contains both mercury and sulphur,
      for "we must not imagine, according to their mistake who say, that the
      Male Agent himself approaches the Female in the coagulation, and departs
      afterwards; because, as is known in every generation, the conception is
      active and passive: Both the active and the passive, that is, all the four
      Elements, must always abide together, otherwise there would be no mixture,
      and the hope of generating an off-spring would be extinguished."(2)

      In conclusion, I wish to say something of the role of sex in spiritual
      alchemy. But in doing this I am venturing outside the original field of
      inquiry of this essay and making a by no means necessary addition to my
      thesis; and I am anxious that what follows should be understood as such,
      so that no confusion as to the issues may arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great alchemical collection of J. J. MANGET, there is a curious
      work (originally published in 1677), entitled <i>Mutus Liber</i>, which
      consists entirely of plates, without letterpress. Its interest for us in
      our present concern is that the alchemist, from the commencement of the
      work until its achievement, is shown working in conjunction with a woman.
      We are reminded of NICOLAS FLAMEL (1330-1418), who is reputed to have
      achieved the <i>magnum opus</i> together with his wife PERNELLE, as well
      as of the many other women workers in the Art of whom we read. It would be
      of interest in this connection to know exactly what association of ideas
      was present in the mind of MICHAEL MAIER when he commanded the alchemist:
      "Perform a work of women on the molten white lead, that is, cook,"(1a) and
      illustrated his behest with a picture of a pregnant woman watching a fire
      over which is suspended a cauldron and on which are three jars. There is a
      cat in the background, and a tub containing two fish in the foreground,
      the whole forming a very curious collection of emblems. Mr WAITE, who has
      dealt with some of these matters, luminously, though briefly, says: "The
      evidences with which we have been dealing concern solely the physical work
      of alchemy and there is nothing of its mystical aspects. The <i>Mutus
      Liber</i> is undoubtedly on the literal side of metallic transmutation;
      the memorials of Nicholas Flamel are also on that side," <i>etc</i>. He
      adds, however, that "It is on record that an unknown master testified to
      his possession of the mystery, but he added that he had not proceeded to
      the work because he had failed to meet with an elect woman who was
      necessary thereto"; and proceeds to say: "I suppose that the statement
      will awaken in most minds only a vague sense of wonder, and I can merely
      indicate in a few general words that which I see behind it. Those Hermetic
      texts which bear a spiritual interpretation and are as if a record of
      spiritual experience present, like the literature of physical alchemy, the
      following aspects of symbolism: (<i>a</i>) the marriage of sun and moon; (<i>b</i>)
      of a mystical king and queen; (<i>c</i>) an union between natures which
      are one at the root but diverse in manifestation; (<i>d</i>) a
      transmutation which follows this union and an abiding glory therein. It is
      ever a conjunction between male and female in a mystical sense; it is ever
      the bringing together by art of things separated by an imperfect order of
      things; it is ever the perfection of natures by means of this conjunction.
      But if the mystical work of alchemy is an inward work in consciousness,
      then the union between male and female is an union in consciousness; and
      if we remember the traditions of a state when male and female had not as
      yet been divided, it may dawn upon us that the higher alchemy was a
      practice for the return into this ineffable mode of being. The traditional
      doctrine is set forth in the <i>Zohar</i> and it is found in writers like
      Jacob Boehme; it is intimated in the early chapters of Genesis and,
      according to an apocryphal saying of Christ, the kingdom of heaven will be
      manifested when two shall be as one, or when that state has been once
      again attained. In the light of this construction we can understand why
      the mystical adept went in search of a wise woman with whom the work could
      be performed; but few there be that find her, and he confessed to his own
      failure. The part of woman in the physical practice of alchemy is like a
      reflection at a distance of this more exalted process, and there is
      evidence that those who worked in metals and sought for a material elixir
      knew that there were other and greater aspects of the Hermetic
      mystery."(1b)

      So far Mr WAITE, whose impressive words I have quoted at some length; and
      he has given us a fuller account of the theory as found in the <i>Zohar</i>
      in his valuable work on <i>The Secret Doctrine in Israel</i> (1913). The
      <i>Zohar</i> regards marriage and the performance of the sexual function
      in marriage as of supreme importance, and this not merely because marriage
      symbolises a divine union, unless that expression is held to include all
      that logically follows from the fact, but because, as it seems, the sexual
      act in marriage may, in fact, become a ritual of transcendental magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least three varieties of opinion can be traced from the view of sex we
      have under consideration, as to the nature of the perfect man, and hence
      of the most adequate symbol for transmutation. According to one, and this
      appears to have been JACOB BOEHME'S view, the perfect man is conceived of
      as non-sexual, the male and female elements united in him having, as it
      were, neutralised each other. According to another, he is pictured as a
      hermaphroditic being, a concept we frequently come across in alchemical
      literature. It plays a prominent part in MAIER'S book <i>Atalanta Fugiens</i>,
      to which reference has already been made. MAIER'S hermaphrodite has two
      heads, one male, one female, but only one body, one pair of arms, and one
      pair of legs. The two sexual organs, which are placed side by side, are
      delineated in the illustrations with considerable care, showing the
      importance MAIER attached to the idea. This concept seems to me not only
      crude, but unnatural and repellent. But it may be said of both the
      opinions I have mentioned, that they confuse between union and identity.
      It is the old mistake, with respect to a lesser goal, of those who hope
      for absorption in the Divine Nature and consequent loss of personality. It
      seems to be forgotten that a certain degree of distinction is necessary to
      the joy of union. "Distinction" and "separation," it should be remembered,
      have different connotations. If the supreme joy is that of self-sacrifice,
      then the self must be such that it can be continually sacrificed, else the
      joy is a purely transitory one, or rather, is destroyed at the moment of
      its consummation. Hence, though sacrificed, the self must still remain
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third view of perfection, to which these remarks naturally lead, is
      that which sees it typified in marriage. The mystic-philosopher SWEDENBORG
      has some exceedingly suggestive things to say on the matter in his
      extraordinary work on <i>Conjugial Love</i>, which, curiously enough, seem
      largely to have escaped the notice of students of these high mysteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEDENBORG'S heaven is a sexual heaven, because for him sex is primarily a
      spiritual fact, and only secondarily, and because of what it is primarily,
      a physical fact; and salvation is hardly possible, according to him, apart
      from a genuine marriage (whether achieved here or hereafter). Man and
      woman are considered as complementary beings, and it is only through the
      union of one man with one woman that the perfect angel results. The
      altruistic tendency of such a theory as contrasted with the egotism of one
      in which perfection is regarded as obtainable by each personality of
      itself alone, is a point worth emphasising. As to the nature of this
      union, it is, to use SWEDENBORG'S own terms, a conjunction of the will of
      the wife with the understanding of the man, and reciprocally of the
      understanding of the man with the will of the wife. It is thus a
      manifestation of that fundamental marriage between the good and the true
      which is at the root of all existence; and it is because of this
      fundamental marriage that all men and women are born into the desire to
      complete themselves by conjunction. The symbol of sexual intercourse is a
      legitimate one to use in speaking of this heavenly union; indeed, we may
      describe the highest bliss attainable by the soul, or conceivable by the
      mind, as a spiritual orgasm. Into conjugal love "are collected," says
      SWEDENBORG, "all the blessednesses, blissfulnesses, delightsomenesses,
      pleasantnesses, and pleasures, which could possibly be conferred upon man
      by the Lord the Creator."(1) In another place he writes: "Married partners
      (in heaven) enjoy similar intercourse with each other as in the world, but
      more delightful and blessed; yet without prolification, for which, or in
      place of which, they have spiritual prolification, which is that of love
      and wisdom." "The reason," he adds, "why the intercourse then is more
      delightful and blessed is, that when conjugial love becomes of the spirit,
      it becomes more interior and pure, and consequently more perceptible; and
      every delightsomeness grows according to the perception, and grows even
      until its blessedness is discernible in its delightsomeness."(1b) Such
      love, however, he says, is rarely to be found on earth.

      A learned Japanese speaks with approval of Idealism as a "dream where
      sensuousness and spirituality find themselves to be blood brothers or
      sisters."(2) It is a statement which involves either the grossest and most
      dangerous error, or the profoundest truth, according to the understanding
      of it. Woman is a road whereby man travels either to God or the devil. The
      problem of sex is a far deeper problem than appears at first sight,
      involving mysteries both the direst and most holy. It is by no means a
      fantastic hypothesis that the inmost mystery of what a certain school of
      mystics calls "the Secret Tradition" was a sexual one. At any rate, the
      fact that some of those, at least, to whom alchemy connoted a mystical
      process, were alive to the profound spiritual significance of sex, renders
      of double interest what they have to intimate of the achievement of the <i>Magnum
      Opus</i> in man.

      XI. ROGER BACON: AN APPRECIATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT has been said that "a prophet is not without honour, save in his own
      country." Thereto might be added, "and in his own time"; for, whilst there
      is continuity in time, there is also evolution, and England of to-day, for
      instance, is not the same country as England of the Middle Ages. In his
      own day ROGER BACON was accounted a magician, whose heretical views called
      for suppression by the Church. And for many a long day afterwards was he
      mainly remembered as a co-worker in the black art with Friar BUNGAY, who
      together with him constructed, by the aid of the devil and diabolical
      rites, a brazen head which should possess the power of speech&mdash;the
      experiment only failing through the negligence of an assistant.(1) Such
      was ROGER BACON in the memory of the later Middle Ages and many succeeding
      years; he was the typical alchemist, where that term carries with it the
      depth of disrepute, though indeed alchemy was for him but one, and that
      not the greatest, of many interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) The story, of course, is entirely fictitious. For further particulars
      see Sir J. E. SANDYS' essay on "Roger Bacon in English Literature," in <i>Roger
      Bacon Essays</i> (1914), referred to below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ilchester, in Somerset, claims the honour of being the place of ROGER
      BACON'S birth, which interesting and important event occurred, probably,
      in 1214. Young BACON studied theology, philosophy, and what then passed
      under the name of "science," first at Oxford, then the centre of liberal
      thought, and afterwards at Paris, in the rigid orthodoxy of whose
      professors he found more to criticise than to admire. Whilst at Oxford he
      joined the Franciscan Order, and at Paris he is said, though this is
      probably an error, to have graduated as Doctor of Theology. During
      1250-1256 we find him back in England, no doubt engaged in study and
      teaching. About the latter year, however, he is said to have been banished&mdash;on
      a charge of holding heterodox views and indulging in magical practices&mdash;to
      Paris, where he was kept in close confinement and forbidden to write. Mr
      LITTLE,(1) however, believes this to be an error, based on a misreading of
      a passage in one of BACON'S works, and that ROGER was not imprisoned, but
      stricken with sickness. At any rate it is not improbable that some
      restrictions as to his writing were placed on him by his superiors of the
      Franciscan Order. In 1266 BACON received a letter from Pope CLEMENT asking
      him to send His Holiness his works in writing without delay. This letter
      came as a most pleasant surprise to BACON; but he had nothing of
      importance written, and in great haste and excitement, therefore, he
      composed three works explicating his philosophy, the <i>Opus Majus</i>,
      the <i>Opus Minus</i>, and the <i>Opus Tertium</i>, which were completed
      and dispatched to the Pope by the end of the following year. This, as Mr
      ROWBOTTOM remarks, is "surely one of the literary feats of history,
      perhaps only surpassed by Swedenborg when he wrote six theological and
      philosophical treatises in one year."(1b)

    <p>
      The works appear to have been well received. We next find BACON at Oxford
      writing his <i>Compendium Studii Philosophiae</i>, in which work he
      indulged in some by no means unjust criticisms of the clergy, for which he
      fell under the condemnation of his order, and was imprisoned in 1277 on a
      charge of teaching "suspected novelties". In those days any knowledge of
      natural phenomena beyond that of the quasi-science of the times was
      regarded as magic, and no doubt some of ROGER BACON'S "suspected
      novelties" were of this nature; his recognition of the value of the
      writings of non-Christian moralists was, no doubt, another "suspected
      novelty". Appeals for his release directed to the Pope proved fruitless,
      being frustrated by JEROME D'ASCOLI, General of the Franciscan Order, who
      shortly afterwards succeeded to the Holy See under the title of NICHOLAS
      IV. The latter died in 1292, whereupon RAYMOND GAUFREDI, who had been
      elected General of the Franciscan Order, and who, it is thought, was well
      disposed towards BACON, because of certain alchemical secrets the latter
      had revealed to him, ordered his release. BACON returned to Oxford, where
      he wrote his last work, the <i>Compendium Studii Theologiae</i>. He died
      either in this year or in 1294.(1)

    <p>
      It was not until the publication by Dr SAMUEL JEBB, in 1733, of the
      greater part of BACON'S <i>Opus Majus</i>, nearly four and a half
      centuries after his death, that anything like his rightful position in the
      history of philosophy began to be assigned to him. But let his spirit be
      no longer troubled, if it were ever troubled by neglect or slander, for
      the world, and first and foremost his own country, has paid him due
      honour. His septcentenary was duly celebrated in 1914 at his <i>alma mater</i>,
      Oxford, his statue has there been raised as a memorial to his greatness,
      and savants have meted out praise to him in no grudging tones.(2) Indeed,
      a voice has here and there been heard depreciating his better-known
      namesake FRANCIS,(3) so that the later luminary should not, standing in
      the way, obscure the light of the earlier; though, for my part, I would
      suggest that one need not be so one-eyed as to fail to see both lights at
      once.

      To those who like to observe coincidences, it may be of interest that the
      septcentenary of the discoverer of gunpowder should have coincided with
      the outbreak of the greatest war under which the world has yet groaned,
      even though gunpowder is no longer employed as a military propellant.
    </p>
    <p>
      BACON'S reference to gunpowder occurs in his <i>Epistola de Secretis
      Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae</i> (Hamburg, 1618) a
      little tract written against magic, in which he endeavours to show, and
      succeeds very well in the first eight chapters, that Nature and art can
      perform far more extraordinary feats than are claimed by the workers in
      the black art. The last three chapters are written in an alchemical jargon
      of which even one versed in the symbolic language of alchemy can make no
      sense. They are evidently cryptogramic, and probably deal with the
      preparation and purification of saltpetre, which had only recently been
      discovered as a distinct body.(1) In chapter xi. there is reference to an
      explosive body, which can only be gunpowder; by means of it, says BACON,
      you may, "if you know the trick, produce a bright flash and a thundering
      noise." He mentions two of the ingredients, saltpetre and sulphur, but
      conceals the third (<i>i.e</i>. charcoal) under an anagram. Claims have,
      indeed, been put forth for the Greek, Arab, Hindu, and Chinese origins of
      gunpowder, but a close examination of the original ancient accounts
      purporting to contain references to gunpowder, shows that only incendiary
      and not explosive bodies are really dealt with. But whilst ROGER BACON
      knew of the explosive property of a mixture in right proportions of
      sulphur, charcoal, and pure saltpetre (which he no doubt accidentally hit
      upon whilst experimenting with the last-named body), he was unaware of its
      projective power. That discovery, so detrimental to the happiness of man
      ever since, was, in all probability, due to BERTHOLD SCHWARZ about 1330.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) For an attempted explanation of this cryptogram, and evidence that
      BACON was the discoverer of gunpowder, see Lieut.-Col. H. W. L. HIME'S <i>Gunpowder
      and Ammunition: their Origin and Progress</i> (1904).
    </p>
    <p>
      ROGER BACON has been credited(1) with many other discoveries. In the work
      already referred to he allows his imagination freely to speculate as to
      the wonders that might be accomplished by a scientific utilisation of
      Nature's forces&mdash;marvellous things with lenses, in bringing distant
      objects near and so forth, carriages propelled by mechanical means, flying
      machines...&mdash;but in no case is the word "discovery" in any sense
      applicable, for not even in the case of the telescope does BACON describe
      means by which his speculations might be realised.
    </p>

      Bacon: His Relations to Alchemy and Chemistry," to <i>Roger Bacon Essays</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, ROGER BACON has often been maligned for his beliefs in
      astrology and alchemy, but, as the late Dr BRIDGES (who was quite
      sceptical of the claims of both) pointed out, not to have believed in them
      in BACON'S day would have been rather an evidence of mental weakness than
      otherwise. What relevant facts were known supported alchemical and
      astrological hypotheses. Astrology, Dr BRIDGES writes, "conformed to the
      first law of Comte's <i>philosophia prima</i>, as being the best
      hypothesis of which ascertained phenomena admitted."(1) And in his
      alchemical speculations BACON was much in advance of his contemporaries,
      and stated problems which are amongst those of modern chemistry.

    <p>
      (1) <i>Op. cit</i>., p.84.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROGER BACON'S greatness does not lie in the fact that he discovered
      gunpowder, nor in the further fact that his speculations have been
      validated by other men. His greatness lies in his secure grip of
      scientific method as a combination of mathematical reasoning and
      experiment. Men before him had experimented, but none seemed to have
      realised the importance of the experimental method. Nor was he, of course,
      by any means the first mathematician&mdash;there was a long line of Greek
      and Arabian mathematicians behind him, men whose knowledge of the science
      was in many cases much greater than his&mdash;or the most learned
      mathematician of his day; but none realised the importance of mathematics
      as an organon of scientific research as he did; and he was assuredly the
      priest who joined mathematics to experiment in the bonds of sacred
      matrimony. We must not, indeed, look for precise rules of inductive
      reasoning in the works of this pioneer writer on scientific method. Nor do
      we find really satisfactory rules of induction even in the works of
      FRANCIS BACON. Moreover, the latter despised mathematics, and it was not
      until in quite recent years that the scientific world came to realise that
      ROGER'S method is the more fruitful&mdash;witness the modern revolution in
      chemistry produced by the adoption of mathematical methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROGER BACON, it may be said, was many centuries in advance of his time;
      but it is equally true that he was the child of his time; this may account
      for his defects judged by modern standards. He owed not a little to his
      contemporaries: for his knowledge and high estimate of philosophy he was
      largely indebted to his Oxford master GROSSETESTE (<i>c</i>. 1175-1253),
      whilst PETER PEREGRINUS, his friend at Paris, fostered his love of
      experiment, and the Arab mathematicians, whose works he knew, inclined his
      mind to mathematical studies. He was violently opposed to the scholastic
      views current in Paris at his time, and attacked great thinkers like
      THOMAS AQUINAS (<i>c</i>. 1225-1274) and ALBERTUS MAGNUS (1193-1280), as
      well as obscurantists, such as ALEXANDER of HALES (<i>ob</i>. 1245). But
      he himself was a scholastic philosopher, though of no servile type, taking
      part in scholastic arguments. If he declared that he would have all the
      works of ARISTOTLE burned, it was not because he hated the Peripatetic's
      philosophy&mdash;though he could criticise as well as appreciate at times,&mdash;but
      because of the rottenness of the translations that were then used. It
      seems commonplace now, but it was a truly wonderful thing then: ROGER
      BACON believed in accuracy, and was by no means destitute of literary
      ethics. He believed in correct translation, correct quotation, and the
      acknowledgment of the sources of one's quotations&mdash;unheard-of things,
      almost, in those days. But even he was not free from all the vices of his
      age: in spite of his insistence upon experimental verification of the
      conclusions of deductive reasoning, in one place, at least, he adopts a
      view concerning lenses from another writer, of which the simplest attempt
      at such verification would have revealed the falsity. For such lapses,
      however, we can make allowances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another and undeniable claim to greatness rests on ROGER BACON'S
      broad-mindedness. He could actually value at their true worth the moral
      philosophies of non-Christian writers&mdash;SENECA (<i>c</i>. 5 B.C.-A.D.
      65) and AL GHAZZALI (1058-1111), for instance. But if he was catholic in
      the original meaning of that term, he was also catholic in its restricted
      sense. He was no heretic: the Pope for him was the Vicar of CHRIST, whom
      he wished to see reign over the whole world, not by force of arms, but by
      the assimilation of all that was worthy in that world. To his mind&mdash;and
      here he was certainly a child of his age, in its best sense, perhaps&mdash;all
      other sciences were handmaidens to theology, queen of them all. All were
      to be subservient to her aims: the Church he called "Catholic" was to
      embrace in her arms all that was worthy in the works of "profane" writers&mdash;true
      prophets of God, he held, in so far as writing worthily they unconsciously
      bore testimony to the truth of Christianity,&mdash;and all that Nature
      might yield by patient experiment and speculation guided by mathematics.
      Some minds see in this a defect in his system, which limited his aims and
      outlook; others see it as the unifying principle giving coherence to the
      whole. At any rate, the Church, as we have seen, regarded his views as
      dangerous, and restrained his pen for at least a considerable portion of
      his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROGER BACON may seem egotistic in argument, but his mind was humble to
      learn. He was not superstitious, but he would listen to common folk who
      worked with their hands, to astrologers, and even magicians, denying
      nothing which seemed to him to have some evidence in experience: if he
      denied much of magical belief, it was because he found it lacking in such
      evidence. He often went astray in his views; he sometimes failed to apply
      his own method, and that method was, in any case, primitive and crude. But
      it was the RIGHT method, in embryo at least, and ROGER BACON, in spite of
      tremendous opposition, greater than that under which any man of science
      may now suffer, persisted in that method to the end, calling upon his
      contemporaries to adopt it as the only one which results in right
      knowledge. Across the centuries&mdash;or, rather, across the gulf that
      divides this world from the next&mdash;let us salute this great and noble
      spirit.

    <h2>
      XII. THE CAMBRIDGE PLATONISTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      THERE is an opinion, unfortunately very common, that religious mysticism
      is a product of the emotional temperament, and is diametrically opposed to
      the spirit of rationalism. No doubt this opinion is not without some
      element of justification, and one could quote the works of not a few
      religious mystics to the effect that self-surrender to God implies, not
      merely a giving up of will, but also of reason. But that this teaching is
      not an essential element in mysticism, that it is, indeed, rather its
      perversion, there is adequate evidence to demonstrate. SWEDENBORG is, I
      suppose, the outstanding instance of an intellectual mystic; but the
      essential unity of mysticism and rationalism is almost as forcibly made
      evident in the case of the Cambridge Platonists. That little band of
      "Latitude men," as their contemporaries called them, constitutes one of
      the finest schools of philosophy that England has produced; yet their
      works are rarely read, I am afraid, save by specialists. Possibly,
      however, if it were more commonly known what a wealth of sound philosophy
      and true spiritual teaching they contain, the case would be otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cambridge Platonists&mdash;BENJAMIN WHICHCOTE, JOHN SMITH, NATHANAEL
      CULVERWEL, RALPH CUDWORTH, and HENRY MORE are the more outstanding names&mdash;were
      educated as Puritans; but they clearly realised the fundamental error of
      Puritanism, which tended to make a man's eternal salvation depend upon the
      accuracy and extent of his beliefs; nor could they approve of the
      exaggerated import given by the High Church party to matters of Church
      polity. The term "Cambridge Platonists" is, perhaps, less appropriate than
      that of "Latitudinarians," which latter name emphasises their
      broad-mindedness (even if it carries with it something of disapproval).
      For although they owed much to PTATO, and, perhaps, more to PLOTINUS (<i>c</i>.
      A.D. 203-262), they were Christians first and Platonists afterwards, and,
      with the exception, perhaps, of MORE, they took nothing from these
      philosophers which was not conformable to the Scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENJAMIN WHICHCOTE was born in 1609, at Whichcote Hall, in the parish of
      Stoke, Shropshire. In 1626 he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, then
      regarded as the chief Puritan college of the University. Here his college
      tutor was ANTHONY TUCKNEY (1599-1670), a man of rare character, combining
      learning, wit, and piety. Between WHICHCOTE and TUCKNEY there grew up a
      firm friendship, founded on mutual affection and esteem. But TUCKNEY was
      unable to agree with all WHICHCOTE'S broad-minded views concerning reason
      and authority; and in later years this gave rise to a controversy between
      them, in which TUCKNEY sought to controvert WHICHCOTE'S opinions: it was,
      however, carried on without acrimony, and did not destroy their
      friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHICHCOTE became M.A., and was elected a fellow of his college, in 1633,
      having obtained his B.A. four years previously. He was ordained by JOHN
      WILLIAMS in 1636, and received the important appointment of Sunday
      afternoon lecturer at Trinity Church. His lectures, which he gave with the
      object of turning men's minds from polemics to the great moral and
      spiritual realities at the basis of the Christian religion, from mere
      formal discussions to a true searching into the reason of things, were
      well attended and highly appreciated; and he held the appointment for
      twenty years. In 1634 he became college tutor at Emmanuel. He possessed
      all the characteristics that go to make up an efficient and well-beloved
      tutor, and his personal influence was such as to inspire all his pupils,
      amongst whom were both JOHN SMITH and NATHANAEL CULVERWEL, who
      considerably amplified his philosophical and religious doctrines. In 1640
      he became B.D., and nine years after was created D.D. The college living
      of North Cadbury, in Somerset, was presented to him in 1643, and shortly
      afterwards he married. In the next year, however, he was recalled to
      Cambridge, and installed as Provost of King's College in place of the
      ejected Dr SAMUEL COLLINS. But it was greatly against his wish that he
      received the appointment, and he only consented to do so on the condition
      that part of his stipend should be paid to COLLINS&mdash;an act which
      gives us a good insight into the character of the man. In 1650 he resigned
      North Cadbury, and the living was presented to CUDWORTH (see below), and
      towards the end of this year he was elected Vice-Chancellor of the
      University in succession to TUCKNEY. It was during his Vice-Chancellorship
      that he preached the sermon that gave rise to the controversy with the
      latter. About this time also he was presented with the living of Milton,
      in Cambridgeshire. At the Restoration he was ejected from the Provostship,
      but, having complied with the Act of Uniformity, he was, in 1662,
      appointed to the cure of St Anne's, Blackfriars. This church being
      destroyed in the Great Fire, WHICHCOTE retired to Milton, where he showed
      great kindness to the poor. But some years later he returned to London,
      having received the vicarage of St Lawrence, Jewry. His friends at
      Cambridge, however, still saw him on occasional visits, and it was on one
      such visit to CUDWORTH, in 1683, that he caught the cold which caused his
      death.

      JOHN SMITH was born at Achurch, near Oundle, in 1618. He entered Emmanuel
      College in 1636, became B.A. in 1640, and proceeded to M.A. in 1644, in
      which year he was appointed a fellow of Queen's College. Here he lectured
      on arithmetic with considerable success. He was noted for his great
      learning, especially in theology and Oriental languages, as well as for
      his justness, uprightness, and humility. He died of consumption in 1652.
    </p>
    <p>
      NATHANAEL CULVERWEL was probably born about the same year as SMITH. He
      entered Emmanuel College in 1633, gained his B.A. in 1636, and became M.A.
      in 1640. Soon afterwards he was elected a fellow of his college. He died
      about 1651. Beyond these scant details, nothing is known of his life. He
      was a man of very great erudition, as his posthumous treatise on <i>The
      Light of Nature</i> makes evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      HENRY MORE was born at Grantham in 1614. From his earliest days he was
      interested in theological problems, and his precociousness in this respect
      appears to have brought down on him the wrath of an uncle. His early
      education was conducted at Eton. In 1631 he entered Christ's College,
      Cambridge, graduated B.A. in 1635, and received his M.A. in 1639. In the
      latter year he was elected a fellow of Christ's and received Holy Orders.
      He lived a very retired life, refusing all preferment, though many
      valuable and honourable appointments were offered to him. Indeed, he
      rarely left Christ's, except to visit his "heroine pupil," Lady CONWAY,
      whose country seat, Ragley, was in Warwickshire. Lady CONWAY (<i>ob</i>.
      1679) appears to be remembered only for the fact that, dying whilst her
      husband was away, her physician, F. M. VAN HELMONT (1618-1699) (son of the
      famous alchemist, J. B. VAN HELMONT, whom we have met already on these
      excursions), preserved her body in spirits of wine, so that he could have
      the pleasure of beholding it on his return. She seems to have been a woman
      of considerable learning, though not free from fantastic ideas. Her
      ultimate conversion to Quakerism was a severe blow to MORE, who, whilst
      admiring the holy lives of the Friends, regarded them as enthusiasts. MORE
      died in 1687.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE'S earliest works were in verse, and exhibit fine feeling. The
      following lines, quoted from a poem on "Charitie and Humilitie," are full
      of charm, and well exhibit MORE'S character:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Farre have I clambred in my mind
     But nought so great as love I find:
     Deep-searching wit, mount-moving might,
     Are nought compar'd to that great spright.
     Life of Delight and soul of blisse!
     Sure source of lasting happinesse!
     Higher than Heaven! lower than hell!
     What is thy tent? Where maist thou dwell?
         My mansion highs humilitie,
     Heaven's vastest capabilitie
     The further it doth downward tend
     The higher up it doth ascend;
     If it go down to utmost nought
     It shall return with that it sought."(1)
</pre>
    <p>
      (1) See <i>The Life of the Learned and Pious Dr Henry More... by</i>
      RICHARD WARD, A.M., <i>to which are annexed Divers Philosophical Poems and
      Hymns</i>. Edited by M. F. HOWARD (1911), pp. 250 and 251.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later he took to prose, and it must be confessed that he wrote too much
      and frequently descended to polemics (for example, his controversy with
      the alchemist THOMAS VAUGHAN, in which both combatants freely used abuse).
    </p>
    <p>
      Although in his main views MORE is thoroughly characteristic of the school
      to which he belonged, many of his less important opinions are more or less
      peculiar to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relation between MORE's and DESCARTES' (1596-1650) theories as to the
      nature of spirit is interesting. When MORE first read DESCARTES' works he
      was favourably impressed with his views, though without entirely agreeing
      with him on all points; but later the difference became accentuated.
      DESCARTES regarded extension as the chief characteristic of matter, and
      asserted that spirit was extra-spatial. To MORE this seemed like denying
      the existence of spirit, which he regarded as extended, and he postulated
      divisibility and impenetrability as the chief characteristics of matter.
      In order, however, to get over some of the inherent difficulties of this
      view, he put forward the suggestion that spirit is extended in four
      dimensions: thus, its apparent (<i>i.e</i>. three-dimensional) extension
      can change, whilst its true (<i>i.e</i>. four-dimensional) extension
      remains constant; just as the surface of a piece of metal can be increased
      by hammering it out, without increasing the volume of the metal. Here, I
      think, we have a not wholly inadequate symbol of the truth; but it
      remained for BERKELEY (1685-1753) to show position, by demonstrating that,
      since space and extension are perceptions of the mind, and thus exist only
      in the mind as ideas, space exists in spirit: not spirit in space.
    </p>
    <p>
      MORE was a keen believer in witchcraft, and eagerly investigated all cases
      of these and like marvels that came under his notice. In this he was
      largely influenced by JOSEPH GLANVIL (1636-1680), whose book on
      witchcraft, the well-known <i>Saducismus Triumphatus</i>, MORE largely
      contributed to, and probably edited. MORE was wholly unsuited for
      psychical research; free from guile himself, he was too inclined to judge
      others to be of this nature also. But his common sense and critical
      attitude towards enthusiasm saved him, no doubt, from many falls into the
      mire of fantasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Principal TULLOCH has pointed out, whilst MORE is the most interesting
      personality amongst the Cambridge Platonists, his works are the least
      interesting of those of his school. They are dull and scholastic, and
      MORE'S retired existence prevented him from grasping in their fulness some
      of the more acute problems of life. His attempt to harmonise catastrophes
      with Providence, on the ground that the evil of certain parts may be
      necessary for the good of the whole, just as dark colours, as well as
      bright, are essential to the beauty of a picture&mdash;a theory which is
      practically the same as that of modern Absolutism,(1)&mdash;is a case in
      point. No doubt this harmony may be accomplished, but in another key.

      RALPH CUDWORTH was born at Aller, in Somersetshire, in 1617. He entered
      Emmanuel College in 1632, three years afterwards gained his B.A., and
      became M.A. in 1639. In the latter year he was elected a fellow of his
      college. Later he obtained the B.D. degree. In 1645 he was appointed
      Master of Clare Hall, in place of the ejected Dr PASHE, and was elected
      Regius Professor of Hebrew. On 31st March 1647 he preached a sermon of
      remarkable eloquence and power before the House of Commons, which
      admirably expresses the attitude of his school as concerns the nature of
      true religion. I shall refer to it again later. In 1650 CUDWORTH was
      presented with the college living of North Cadbury, which WHICHCOTE had
      resigned, and was made D.D. in the following year. In 1654 he was elected
      Master of Christ's College, with an improvement in his financial position,
      there having been some difficulty in obtaining his stipend at Clare Hall.
      In this year he married. In 1662 Bishop SHELDON presented him with the
      rectory of Ashwell, in Hertfordshire. He died in 1688. He was a pious man
      of fine intellect; but his character was marred by a certain
      suspiciousness which caused him wrongfully to accuse MORE, in 1665, of
      attempting to forestall him in writing a work on ethics, which should
      demonstrate that the principles of Christian morality are not based on any
      arbitrary decrees of God, but are inherent in the nature and reason of
      things. CUDWORTH'S great work&mdash;or, at least, the first part, which
      alone was completed,&mdash;<i>The Intellectual System of the World</i>,
      appeared in 1678. In it CUDWORTH deals with atheism on the ground of
      reason, demonstrating its irrationality. The book is remarkable for the
      fairness and fulness with which CUDWORTH states the arguments in favour of
      atheism.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the lives and individual characteristics of the Cambridge
      Platonists: what were the great principles that animated both their lives
      and their philosophy? These, I think, were two: first, the essential unity
      of religion and morality; second, the essential unity of revelation and
      reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      With clearer perception of ethical truth than either Puritan or High
      Churchman, the Cambridge Platonists saw that true Christianity is neither
      a matter of mere belief, nor consists in the mere performance of good
      works; but is rather a matter of character. To them Christianity connoted
      regeneration. "Religion," says WHICHCOTE, "is the Frame and TEMPER of our
      Minds, and the RULE of our Lives"; and again, "Heaven is FIRST a Temper,
      and THEN a Place."(1) To the man of heavenly temper, they taught, the
      performance of good works would be no irksome matter imposed merely by a
      sense of duty, but would be done spontaneously as a delight. To drudge in
      religion may very well be necessary as an initial stage, but it is not its
      perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) My quotations from WHICHCOTE and SMITH are taken from the selection of
      their discourses edited by E. T. CAMPAGNAC, M.A. (1901).
    </p>
    <p>
      In his sermon before the House of Commons, CUDWORTH well exposes the error
      of those who made the mere holding of certain beliefs the essential
      element in Christianity. There are many passages I should like to quote
      from this eloquent discourse, but the following must suffice: "We must not
      judge of our knowing of Christ, by our skill in Books and Papers, but by
      our keeping of his Commandments... He is the best Christian, whose heart
      beats with the truest pulse towards heaven; not he whose head spinneth out
      the finest cobwebs. He that endeavours really to mortifie his lusts, and
      to comply with that truth in his life, which his Conscience is convinced
      of; is neerer a Christian, though he never heard of Christ; then he that
      believes all the vulgar Articles of the Christian faith, and plainly
      denyeth Christ in his life.... The great Mysterie of the Gospel, it doth
      not lie only in CHRIST WITHOUT US, (though we must know also what he hath
      done for us) but the very Pith and Kernel of it, consists in <i>*Christ
      inwardly formed</i> in our hearts. Nothing is truly Ours, but what lives
      in our Spirits. SALVATION it self cannot SAVE us, as long as it is onely
      without us; no more then HEALTH can cure us, and make us sound, when it is
      not within us, but somewhere at distance from us; no more than <i>Arts and
      Sciences</i>, whilst they lie onely in Books and Papers without us; can
      make us learned."(1)
    </p>

      of Commons at Westminster, Mar</i>. 31, 1647 (1st edn.), pp. 3, 14, 42,
      and 43.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cambridge Platonists were not ascetics; their moral doctrine was one
      of temperance. Their sound wisdom on this point is well evident in the
      following passage from WHICHCOTE: "What can be alledged for Intemperance;
      since Nature is content with very few things? Why should any one over-do
      in this kind? A Man is better in Health and Strength, if he be temperate.
      We enjoy ourselves more in a sober and temperate Use of ourselves."(2)
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) BENJAMIN WHICHCOTE: <i>The Venerable Nature and Transcendant Benefit
      of Christian Religion. Op. cit</i>., p. 40.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other great principle animating their philosophy was, as I have said,
      the essential unity of reason and revelation. To those who argued that
      self-surrender implied a giving up of reason, they replied that "To go
      against REASON, is to go against GOD: it is the self same thing, to do
      that which the Reason of the Case doth require; and that which God Himself
      doth appoint: Reason is the DIVINE Governor of Man's Life; it is the very
      Voice of God."(3) Reason, Conscience, and the Scriptures, these, taught
      the Cambridge Platonists, testify of one another and are the true guides
      which alone a man should follow. All other authority they repudiated. But
      true reason is not merely sensuous, and the only way whereby it may be
      gained is by the purification of the self from the desires that draw it
      away from the Source of all Reason. "God," writes MORE, "reserves His
      choicest secrets for the purest Minds," adding his conviction that "true
      Holiness (is) the only safe Entrance into Divine Knowledge." Or as SMITH,
      who speaks of "a GOOD LIFE as the PROLEPSIS and Fundamental principle of
      DIVINE SCIENCE," puts it, "... if... KNOWLEDGE be not attended with
      HUMILITY and a deep sense of SELF-PENURY and <i>*Self-emptiness</i>, we
      may easily fall short of that True Knowledge of God which we seem to
      aspire after."(1b) Right Reason, however, they taught, is the product of
      the sight of the soul, the true mystic vision.
    </p>

      67.

      (1b) JOHN SMITH: <i>A Discourse concerning the true Way or Method of
      attaining to Divine Knowledge. Op. cit</i>., pp. 80 and 96.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what respects, it may be asked in conclusion, is the philosophy of the
      Cambridge Platonists open to criticism? They lacked, perhaps, a
      sufficiently clear concept of the Church as a unity, and although they
      clearly realised that Nature is a symbol which it is the function of
      reason to interpret spiritually, they failed, I think, to appreciate the
      value of symbols. Thus they have little to teach with respect to the
      Sacraments of the Church, though, indeed, the highest view, perhaps, is
      that which regards every act as potentially a sacrament; and, whilst
      admiring his morality, they criticised BOEHME as an enthusiast. But,
      although he spoke in a very different language, spiritually he had much in
      common with them. Compared with what is of positive value in their
      philosophy, however, the defects of the Cambridge Platonists are but
      comparatively slight. I commend their works to lovers of spiritual wisdom.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
