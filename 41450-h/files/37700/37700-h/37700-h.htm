        "The Bible contained details of Atrocity at which human nature
        shuddered. Part of the Holy Writings consisted of history and of the
        narration of facts of a kind, that could not be mentioned in the
        presence of a virtuous woman without exciting Horror. Should a woman be
        permitted to read in her chamber what she would tremble to hear at her
        domestic board? Should she con over and revolve what she would rather
        die than utter?"&mdash;[The Right Hon R. L. Shiel, M.P.]

    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The distinguishing characteristic of the present age, is the freedom of
      inquiry and discussion which prevails upon all subjects; and most
      particularly upon religious subjects. Intelligent and thinking men of
      every class, are beginning to investigate and discuss questions of the
      latter kind with considerable closeness, fearlessness and determination.
      They are now resolved no longer to be hoodwinked with the veil of
      prejudice, enchained with the trammels of superstition, or deluded by the
      Hosted by or intimidated by the denunciations of a crafty and intolerant
      priesthood; but to examine for themselves&mdash;"to prove all things, and
      hold fast that which is good." And long have the priesthood dreaded, and
      anxiously have they endeavored to procrastinate, the arrival of this
      period. Long have they been apprehensive of the development of intellect,
      and the enlightenment of mind. Long have they feared the advent of that
      era which will hail the dawn of rationality and advancement. And why?
      Because they knew full well, ignorant and superstitious as many of them
      may appear, that when intellect and rationality become the main-springs of
      society&mdash;when men begin dispassionately and philosophically to
      examine into the mysteries and workings of religion, that all their
      impositions will be discovered, all their craftiness detected, and all
      their designs and practices fully exposed. And, when once this is done,
      they are conscious that their influence over the people, would immediately
      decline, and ultimately fall. This has already in some measure proved
      true. For by the many bold and daring innovations, which have been made by
      a Paine, a Voltaire, a Mirabaud, a Volney, a Taylor, a Howitt, and an
      Owen, upon what is arrogantly called the consecrated ground of religion,
      their influence has materially declined, and has every prospect of still
      continuing to do so. And this they know&mdash;<i>this they feel</i>.
      Hence, the terrific thunderbolts of indignation and anathema which they
      have hurled at the characters of those distinguished men. And hence, that
      malicious and vindictive spirit which they have manifested toward all
      those who have had the integrity or boldness to acknowledge themselves
      their disciples. Hence, too, their present discreditable opposition to
      every educational, political and social measure, which would conduce to
      the elevation and improvement of society. But poor deluded mortals! how
      vain will they find all their attempts to impede the mighty progress of
      truth&mdash;the glorious advancement of thought and enlightenment! As
      well, indeed, might they attempt to overthrow the pyramids of Egypt with
      the waft of a feather, as to endeavor to demolish the temple of reason and
      intellect which is now erecting in society; a temple which, while it will
      be a glorious emblem of the progression of man, will be a lasting monument
      of their final downfall! So considerably, in fact, is the power of the
      priesthood already diminished, that they are now beginning to be looked
      upon by the leading minds of all classes, with feelings of indifference
      and compassion, rather than those of reverence and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the desire to endeavor to hasten the annihilation of the influence
      of these men that induced me to publish the following work&mdash;-a work
      which, I trust, will serve somewhat to expose one of the greatest
      impositions ever palmed upon mankind in any age, or in any country. I
      allude, as may be supposed? to the Bible. Yes, the Christian priesthood
      dare so outrageously to blaspheme the character of the Supreme Governor of
      the Universe as to say, that book is his word; that he either wrote or
      inspired men to write it. O shame, shame upon such blasphemy! What! a
      munificent and omniscient Deity the author of a book replete with more
      contradictions, containing more immoralities, and inculcating more
      absurdities, than any book extant; contradictions, too, of the grossest
      character, immoralities of the most pernicious tendency, and absurdities
      of the most extravagant nature! Audacious impiety! Such an opinion perhaps
      might be entertained in the dark ages of ignorance and superstition, but
      in this the boasted era of reason and science, it must be repudiated by
      all who dare openly and frankly avow their sentiments, This may be deemed
      by those who have always read the Bible with their eyes closed, or who are
      interested in teaching its doctrines and mysteries, as very bold and
      presumptuous; but let the reader refer to the extracts contained in this
      little book, (and which are only a few to what may be adduced) and I am
      persuaded that he will at once acknowledge that I am perfectly justified
      in making these statements, Indeed, so extremely immoral and disgustingly
      obscene, are many passages in this book, that I feel almost ashamed to
      publish them, and I am sure that any one who has the least sense of
      delicacy or chastity, will blush to read them. A book which had really
      originated from an Omniscient and Munificent Divinity&mdash;-a book which
      was the word, or organ of such a being, must inculcate in every chapter
      and in every verse, the strictest, the purest, and most exalted morality;
      must constantly exhort mankind to every thing that was just, rational and
      charitable; and must contain no language but that which was exquisitely
      beautiful and elevating; and no expressions but those which were
      irresistibly persuasive and convincing. But the Bible is a book, as may be
      seen on a reference to these extracts, quite the reverse of this. We are
      compelled, therefore, to conclude against the established opinions of
      society, that it cannot be of Divine origin, and that consequently it
      cannot be the word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      My humble, but decided opinion is, as I have previously observed, that it
      was nothing more than a mere imposition; an imposition which was palmed
      upon mankind by the Christian priesthood, for the purpose of deluding or
      enslaving them; for the purpose of leading them from the open and cheering
      paths of knowledge and improvement, into the nauseous and gloomy quagmires
      of ignorance and superstition. The priesthood of every sect of religion,
      in every country of the habitable globe, have instituted and perpetuated
      certain impositions, by means of which they have conceived they would be
      enabled to maintain and increase their influence over the minds of their
      followers; so that thereby they might still continue to luxuriate in ease
      and enjoyment, while their poor deluded victims repined in ignorance and
      woe. And this is such an imposition now established and supported by the
      Christian priesthood&mdash;an imposition which is the corner stone of all
      their power, the fountain of all their influence. It has been the tool
      which they have invariably used in the accomplishment of their objects,
      however selfish; and in the consummation of their machinations, however
      odious. Whenever they have massacred, immolated, or incarcerated those who
      have dared to dispute their vicegerency, or who have presumed to expose
      their doctrines, or denounce their practices, they have quoted this
      imposition as their authority. Whenever they have defended, or connived at
      the extortions of the tyrants who have flattered or supported them, they
      have quoted this imposition as their authority. Whenever they have opposed
      any system or any measure, which they considered would be inimical to
      their interests, or subversive of their power, they have quoted this
      imposition as their authority. And the sooner this imposition is removed&mdash;the
      sooner the few good seeds which it may contain are extracted from it, and
      the immense mass of chaff is cast into oblivion, the better will it be for
      the amelioration and progression of man. Perhaps the expression of such
      opinions as these may be painful to the feelings of many excellent
      individuals. For this I am truly sorry, as my object is, not to cause pain
      or uneasiness, but to expose error and imposture. The time has now arrived
      when truth must come out, when truth must be spoken, "without mystery,
      mixture of error, or fear of man." Too long, indeed, has this precious
      jewel been sacrificed to the paltry predilections of interest and
      prejudice. Too long have we been tossed in the dark and unfathomable gulf
      of bigotry and intolerance; we must now make our way to the expansive and
      unruffled ocean of reason and inquiry, and there, free from the storms of
      persecution, and the squalls of denunciation, proceed, on our onward
      course, in security and felicity. R. C.

      2. The <i>eyes</i> of the lord are in everyplace, beholding the evil and
      the good. Prov. xv. 3.

      not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and
      it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. Isaiah lv. 11.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me for I am holier than
      thou; these are a smoke in my <i>nose</i>, a fire that burneth all the
      day. Isaiah lxv. 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Behold the name of the Lord cometh from afar burning with his anger and
      the burden thereof is heavy: his <i>lips</i> are full of indignation, and
      his <i>tongue</i> as a devouring fire. Isaiah xxxth, 27.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. And when we cried unto the Lord God of our fathers, the Lord <i>heard</i>
      our voice and <i>looked</i> on our affliction, and our labor and our
      oppression. Deut. xxvi. 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Lord, bow down thine <i>ear</i> and hear, open thine eyes and see; and
      hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living
      God. 2 Kings xix. 16.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place
      of the <i>soles</i> of my <i>feet</i>, where I will dwell in the midst of
      the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of
      Israel no more defile, neither they nor their kings, by their whoredom,
      nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places. Ezek. xliii. 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand, and with
      a strong <i>arm</i> even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. Jer.
      xxi. 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The Lord hath made bare his <i>holy arm</i>, in the eyes of all the
      nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
      Isaiah lii. 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. When I consider the heavens, the work of thy <i>fingers</i>, the moon
      and the stars which thou hast ordained. Psalms viii. 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him
      upon Mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with
      the <i>finger</i> of God. Exod. xxxi. 18.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about
      within it, from the appearance of his <i>loins</i> even upward, and from
      the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance
      of fire, and it had brightness round about it. Ezek. i. 27.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. And it repenteth the Lord that he had made man upon the earth, and it
      grieved him at his <i>heart</i>, Gen. vi. 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. My <i>bowels, my bowels</i>, I am pained at my very <i>heart</i>, my
      heart maketh a noise in me: I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast
      heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. Jer. iv. 19.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. And with the blast of thy <i>nostrils</i> the waters were gathered
      together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were
      congealed in the heart of the sea. Exod. xv. 8.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. And it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by, that I will put
      thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my <i>hand</i> while
      I pass by. And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my <i>back
      parts</i>, but my <i>face</i> shall not be seen. Exod. xxxiii. 22, 23.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. Then the Lord put forth his <i>hand</i> and <i>touched</i> my <i>mouth</i>,
      and the Lord said unto me, Behold I have put my words in thy mouth. Jer.
      i. 9.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. Behold the Lord's <i>hand</i> is not shortened, that it cannot save;
      neither his <i>ear</i> heavy, that it cannot hear. Isaiah lix. 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. Mine <i>hand</i> also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my <i>right
      hand</i> hath spanned the heavens,&mdash;when I call unto them they stand
      up together. Isaiah xlviii. 13.
    </p>
    <p>
      21. I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to
      rest; I the Lord have said it. Ezekiel xxi. 17.

    <p>
      22. And the Lord <i>spake</i> unto Moses, saying. Num. xxv. 16.

    <h2>
      DAVID.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And it came to pass in an evening tide, that David arose from off his bed,
      and walked upon the roof of the king's house, and from the roof he saw a
      young woman washing herself, and the woman was very beautiful to look
      upon. And David sent and enquired after the woman: and one said, Is not
      this Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam, <i>the wife of Uriah the Hittite</i>.
      And David sent messengers and took her; and she came in unto him <i>and he
      lay with her</i>, (for she was purified from her uncleanness,) and she
      returned unto her house. And the woman conceived and sent and told David,
      and said, <i>I am with child</i>. And David sent to Jacob, saying. Send me
      Uriah the Hittite, And Joab sent Uriah to David. 2 Sam. xi. 2 to 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      [The story then proceeds to represent David, <i>the man after God's own
      heart</i>, as endeavoring to cajole the poor cuckold Uriah. But he returns
      to the war without visiting his wife, and David sends a letter with him to
      Joab, in which letter he orders Joab to place Uriah in the front of the
      battle, <i>and then leave him so that he might he killed</i>. Joab obeys
      his orders Uriah is slaughtered, and he then takes Bathsheba his wife and
      marries her in order that he might continue to gratify his lust upon her!]
    </p>
    <p>
      158. And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of
      Achish the king of Gath. And he changed his behavior before them, <i>and
      feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the
      gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard</i>. 1 Sam. xxi. 12,
      13.
    </p>
    <p>
      159. Wherefore David arose, and went, he and his men, and slew of the
      Philistines two hundred men; and <i>David brought their foreskins</i>, and
      they gave them in full tale to the king, <i>that he might be the king's
      son-in-law</i>; and Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. 1 Samuel
      xviii. 27.
    </p>
    <p>
      160. Now King David was old, and stricken in years, and they covered him
      with clothes, but he gat no heat. Wherefore his servants said unto him,
      Let there be sought for my lord the king, <i>a young virgin, and let her
      stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy
      bosom</i>, that my lord the king may get heat. So they sought for a fair
      damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunamite,
      and brought her to the king. And the damsel was very fair, <i>and
      cherished the king, and ministered to him</i>, but the king <i>knew her
      not</i>. 1 King i. 1 to 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      161. And David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, and
      fought against it, and took it. And he took their king's crown from off
      his head, (the weight whereof was a talent of gold, with the precious
      stones.) and it was set on David's head, and he brought forth the spoil of
      the city in great abundance. And he brought forth the people that were
      therein, <i>and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under
      axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln; and thus did he
      unto all the cities of the children of Ammon</i>. So David and all the
      people returned unto Jerusalem. 2 Samuel xii. 29 to 31.
    </p>
    <p>
      162. And behold (says David in his <i>dying moments</i> to his son
      Solomon,) thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, of
      Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse, in the day when I went to
      Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at Jordan, <i>and I sware to him by
      the Lord, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword</i>. Now
      therefore hold him not guiltless; for thou art a wise man, and knowest
      what thou oughtest to do unto him; <i>but his hoary head bring thou down
      to the grave with blood</i>. 1 Kings ii. 8, 9.

      after your enemies, <i>and smite the hindmost of them, suffer them not to

      into your hand. Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring
      out these five kings unto me out of the cave. And afterwards Joshua <i>smote

      of Sarah, his wife, <i>She is my sister</i>; and Abimelech king of Gerar
      sent and took Sarah. But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and
      said unto him. Behold thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou
      hast taken; for she is <i>a man's wife</i>. But Abimelech had not come
      near her; and he said, Lord; wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? Said

      should not be his, and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother's

      her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open
      place which is by the way to Timnath, for she saw that Shelah was grown,
      and she was not given unto him to wife. When Judah saw her, he thought her
      to be an harlot, because she had covered her face. And he turned unto her
      by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, <i>let me come in unto thee;</i>
      (for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law;) and she said, <i>What
      wilt thou give me, that thou mayst come in unto me?</i> And he said, I
      will send thee a kid from the flock; and she said, Wilt thou give me a
      pledge till thou send it. And he said, What pledge shall I give thee! and
      she said, Thy signet and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine
      hand: and he gave it her, <i>and came in to her, and she conceived by him</i>.
      And she arose and went away, and laid by her veil from her, and put on the
      garments of her widowhood. And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his
      friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand, but he
      found her not. Then he asked the men of that place saying, Where is the
      harlot that was openly by the way-side? and they said, there was no harlot
      in this place. And he returned to Judah, and said I cannot find her; and
      also the men of the place said, That there was no harlot in this place.
      And Judah said, let her take it to her lest we be shamed; behold I sent
      this kid, and thou hast not found her. And it came to pass about three
      months after, and it was told Judah say-. ing, Tamar thy daughter-in-law
      <i>hath played the harlot</i>; and also behold, <i>she is with child by
      whoredom</i>; and Judah said, Bring her forth <i>and let her be burnt</i>.
      When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law saying, By the
      man whose these are am I with child; and she said, Discern, I pray thee,
      whose are these, the signet and bracelets and staff. And Judah
      acknowledged them, and said, <i>She hath been more righteous than I</i>;
      because that I gave her not to She-lah my son; and he knew her again no
      more. And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that behold <i>twins
      were in her womb</i>. And it came to pass when she travailed, <i>that the
      one put out his hand</i>; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a
      scarlet thread, saying, <i>This came out first</i>. And it came to pass as
      he drew back his hand, <i>and behold his brother came out</i>; and she
      said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee; therefore his
      name was called Pharez. And afterwards came out his brother that had the

      There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any

    <p>
      181. And it came to pass when Israel dwelt in that land, <i>that Reuben
      went and lay with Bilhah</i>, his father's concubine, and Israel heard it.
      Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. Gen. xxxv. 22.
    </p>
    <p>
      182. Reuben (says Jacob) thou art my first-born, my might, and the
      beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, the excellency of
      power. Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel, <i>because thou wentest up
      to thy father's bed</i>; then defiledst thou it; he went up to my couch.
      Gen. xlix. 3; 4.

      183. And Amnon (David's eldest son), said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into
      the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand: and Tamar took the cakes which
      she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. And
      when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her <i>and said
      unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister</i>. And she answered him, Nay, my
      brother, do not force me, for no such thing ought to be done in Israel; do
      not thou this folly. And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as
      for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel; now, therefore, I
      pray thee, speak unto the king: <i>for he will not withhold me from thee</i>,
      Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but? being stronger than she,
      <i>forced her and lay with her</i>, 2 Samuel xiii. 10 to 14.

      186. If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife

      cannot be my disciple</i>. Luke xiv. 26.
    </p>
    <p>
      187. <i>I am come to send fire on the earth</i>, and what will I if it be
      already kindled. Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? <i>I
      tell you nay; but rather division.</i> Luke xii. 49; 51.
    </p>
    <p>
      188. Think not that I come to send peace on earth; <i>I come not to send
      peace, but a sword</i>. For I am come to set a man at variance against his
      father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law
      against her mother-in-law. Matt. x. 34, 35.
    </p>

      believeth not shall be <i>damned.</i> Mark xvi. 16.

      192. And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of
      the kingdom of God, but unto them that are without, all these things are
      done in <i>parables</i>; That seeing they may see, <i>and not perceive</i>,
      and hearing they may hear, <i>and not understand; lest at any time they
      should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them</i>. Mark iv.
      11, 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      193. And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage, and Bethany, at
      the Mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto
      them, Go your way into the village over against you; and as soon as ye
      enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never mam sat; <i>loose
      him and bring him</i>; and if any man say unto you, Why do you this? <i>Say
      ye that the Lord hath need of him</i>; and straightway he will send him
      hither. Mark xi. 1 to 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      194. And it came to pass that he went through the corn-fields on the
      Sabbath-day, and his disciples began as they went, <i>to pluck the ears of
      corn</i>. And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, <i>why do they on the
      Sabbath-day that which is not lawful?</i> And he said unto them, have ye
      never read what David did when he had need, and was a hungered, he and
      they that were with him? How he went into the house of God in the days of
      Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the show-bread, which is not lawful
      to eat, but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him!
      Mark ii. 23 to 26.
    </p>
    <p>
      195. Now there was there, nigh unto the mountain, a great herd of swine
      feeding. And all the devils besought him saying, Send us into the swine,
      that we may enter into them. <i>And forthwith Jesus gave them leave</i>,
      and the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine; and the herd
      ran violently down a steep place into the sea (they were about <i>two
      thousand</i>) and were choked in the sea. Mark v. 11, 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      196. And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry,
      and seeing a fig-tree afar off, having leaves, he came, if haply he might
      find any thing thereon; and when he came to it he found nothing but
      leaves; <i>for the time of figs was not yet</i>. And Jesus answered and
      said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever: and his
      disciples heard it. And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the
      fig-tree dried up from the roots; and Peter calling to remembrance, saith
      unto him, Master, <i>behold the fig-tree which thou cursedest is withered
      away</i>. Mark xi. 12? 13, 14, 20, 21.

      earnestly looked upon him, and said, this man was also with him. <i>And he

      Israel, <i>Sun stand thou still upon Gibeon,</i> and thou moon in the
      valley of Ajalon. <i>And the sun stood still</i>, and the moon stayed,
      until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this

      kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth
      after his kind; two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive.

      435. And behold there was a great earthquake; for the angel of the Lord
      descended from heaven, and came <i>and rolled back the stone from the
      door, and sat upon it</i>. Matt, xxviii. 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      436. And they said among themselves, who shall roll us away the stone from
      the door of the sepulchre? (And when they looked they saw that the stone
      was rolled away;) for it was very great. And <i>entering</i> into the
      sepulchre, <i>they saw a young man</i> (the angel of the Lord) <i>sitting
      on the right side</i>, clothed in a long white garment; and they were
      affrighted. Mark xvi. 3, 4, 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Thus, in one of these notes the angel is represented as sitting <i>outside</i>
      the sepulchre upon the stone which he rolled from the door, and in the
      other, as sitting <i>within</i> the sepulchre on the right side.]
    </p>
    <p>
      437. And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it
      came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men
      (angels of the Lord) <i>stood</i> by them in shining garments. Luke xxiv.
      3 and 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In notes 435, 436, and 438, the angels of the Lord are represented, not
      as <i>standing</i>, as above, but as <i>sitting</i>.]
    </p>
    <p>
      438. But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping; and as she wept she
      stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre. And seeth <i>two</i> angels
      in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where
      the body of Jesus had lain. John xx, 11, 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In this, and note 437, there are represented as being <i>two</i> angels,
      while according to notes 435 and 434, there was only <i>one</i>. In this
      note also, as well as in note 434, we are told that they had <i>white</i>
      garments on, and in note 435, we are told they were <i>shining</i>
      garments. We are likewise told in this note, that Mary merely <i>looked</i>
      into the sepulchre; while in note 436, we are positively informed, that
      she and those who accompanied her, <i>went into it</i>.]
    </p>
    <p>
      439. And the <i>angel</i> answered and said unto the women, fear not ye;
      for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for he
      is risen, as he said; come, see the place where the Lord lay, Matt,
      xxviii. 5, 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      440. And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus
      standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why
      weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener,
      saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast
      laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her. Mary. She turned
      herself and saith unto him? Rabboni, which is to say, Master. Jesus saith
      unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto my Father: but go
      to my brethren, and say unto them. I ascend unto my Father, and your
      Father, and to my God, and your God. John xx. 14 to.17.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In the former of these notes, the <i>angel</i> is represented as telling
      the women of Christ's rising from the dead; in the latter, <i>Christ</i>
      is represented as telling them <i>himself</i>.]
    </p>
    <p>
      441. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the
      dead; and behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; <i>there shall ye see
      him</i>. Lo, I have told you. Then the eleven disciples <i>went away into
      Galilee</i>, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when <i>they
      saw him they worshipped him</i>; but some doubted. Matt, xxviii. 7, 16,
      17.
    </p>
    <p>
      442. And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and <i>found
      the eleven gathered together,</i> and them that were with them, Saying,
      the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon. And they told what
      things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of
      bread. And as they thus spake, <i>Jesus himself stood in the midst of them</i>,
      and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. Luke xxiv. 33 to 36.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Now we are told in the first of these notes, that the eleven disciples
      went to <i>Galilee</i> to meet Jesus according to appointment, where they
      saw him, and worshipped him; while in the latter we are informed that they
      did no such thing, but that <i>Jesus appeared unto them</i> quite
      unexpectedly, as they were assembled together at Jerusalem.]
    </p>
    <p>
      443. So then, <i>after the Lord had spoken unto them</i>. (the eleven
      apostles that sat at meat,) <i>he was received up into heaven</i>, and sat
      on the right hand of God. Mark xvi. 19.
    </p>
    <p>
      404. <i>And he led them</i> (the eleven Apostles) <i>out as far as to
      Bethany</i>; and he lift up his hands, and blessed them. And it came to
      pass, <i>while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up
      into heaven.</i> Luke xxiv.50, 51.
    </p>
    <p>
      [So we learn from one of these notes, that Christ ascended into heaven, <i>from
      the place where the apostles were sat at meat</i>, after he had done
      speaking to them; and from the other, <i>that he first led them out to
      Bethany</i>, and that <i>then</i> his ascension took place.]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE END.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
